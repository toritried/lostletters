                        Your dominant hues are blue and magenta. 
                        You're the one who goes to all the parties but doesn't quite fit in at every one... you know what you want, but are afraid of what the world might think of it. 
                        You're a little different and that's okay with them, and if you're smart it's okay with you too.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Your saturation level is higher than average - You know what you want, but sometimes know not to tell everyone. 
                        You value accomplishments and know you can get the job done, so don't be afraid to run out and make things happen.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Your outlook on life is bright. 
                        You see good things in situations where others may not be able to, and it frustrates you to see them get down on everything.
