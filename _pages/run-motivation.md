<h1>Run More Easily</h1>
During my consistent running periods (when I'm not sick/injured), these are a few keys to my consistency that are completely free and may help you:
<ul>
    <li><b>Gratitude reflection after every run</b> - This is easiest when I'm in a good mood after running. I like to override my typical negative self-talk with some gratitude towards my body for allowing me the opportunity to run regardless of distance and pace. This helps me remember how good I feel after running.</li>
    <li><b>I don't stress or judge if I have to reschedule a run</b>, which allows me to fit it into my life when I'm more prepared and in a better mindset instead of avoiding the run due to dread.</li>
    <li><b>Use the Run/Walk method</b> - I made running as easy as possible for myself with this method, and paired it with low heart rate training, which has been shown to <a target="_blank" href="https://philmaffetone.com/180-formula/">reduce injury</a> by maintaining proper form at lower levels of exertion. Also, you're still totally a runner even if you take walk breaks, and I have my own run data to prove that I'm faster when I actually use the run/walk method compared to when I just run the same distance. </li>
    <li><b>Follow inpsirational runners</b> - I always get inspired watching a well-edited and hype <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@kofuzi">kofuzi</a> run vlog, informative and helpful running videos from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/runningchannel">The Running Channel</a>, listening to the <a target="_blank" href="https://notyouraveragerunner.com/podcast/">Not Your Average Runner Podcast</a>, or keeping up with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/savannahsachdev/">Savannah Sachdev's fun daily run streak vlogs</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Gamification</b> - Not only can you use the Strava app for free to track your runs for free, you can also sign up to challenges to earn badges and even discounts from corporate challenge sponsors. Because I also have a Garmin watch, I also run and workout to earn badges on Garmin Connect as well.</li>
</ul>
<h1>My Running Gear</h1>
<p>
    While running can be a very economical form of exercise, nerding out on this hobby can get expensive and not very sustainable since running gear is not something you really want to buy used. I have scored heavily discounted "new with tags" items off of resale apps like Poshmark before, so if you need new gear, definitely check there first. <b>None of these are affiliate links</b>, and I'm not being paid to post any of this. I really just love these products, and sometimes buying some new gear can really help motivate me to get back out there and run more:

<ul>
    <li><b>Running Shoes</b> - As a fat, slow runner with plantar fasciitis, I mostly use the max cushion ASICS gel nimbus shoes, but you should go to a running shoe store to have your gait analyzed so you can have pros recommend the best shoe for you. </li>
    <li><b>A GPS watch</b>: My GPS watch is a constant source of inspiration, encouraging me to move my body in so many more ways than just running. It has a variety of incredible features like 5km and 10km training plans, the ability to program workouts with vibrating cues for time, cadence, and distance segments, and so much more. I use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/775697/pn/010-02627-10">Garmin InstinctÂ® 2 Solar</a>, which comes with 28 days of battery life (unlimited with solar) that's literally game changing. </li>
    <li><b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hoka.com/en/us/sale/ora-recovery-slide/1134527.html">HOKA ORA Recovery Slide</a></b> - If you too were told by a doctor to avoid walking barefoot on hard surfaces, these are so good. They're firmer then oofos, but have better arch support and plenty of squish to protect you from heel spur pain, especially after you've created inflammation due to running. </li>
    <li><b><a target="_blank" href="https://shop.lululemon.com/c/women-sports-bras/_/N-7vlZ1z0xsms">Lululemon Enlite Bra</a></b> - They are stupid expensive, but I've used them for over 500 running and HIIT workouts and they still hold up. As someone who needed high support in the past, I couldn't run without these. </li>
    <li><b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.lulufanatics.com/item/25438/lululemon-fast-free-crop-19-black">Lululemon Fast and Free leggings</a></b> - If your weight fluctuates or your get bloated easily, I love the secure, continuous waist band you can adjust infinitely. </li>
</ul>
