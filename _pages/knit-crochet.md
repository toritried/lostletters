        In June 2025, I finished my third Shona top by Irene Lin. It's made with <a target="_blank" href="https://hobbii.com/products/hp-1000996-tencel">Tencel Bamboo Fine, a yarn from Hobbii that is 60% bamboo rayon, 40% tencel</a> (a rayon fiber made from wood pulp), which creates a very cool, slippery drapey fabric that I really enjoy next to skin. It was a nightmare to knit with as it split easily and slid all over my slippery metal Addi interchangeable needles (avoidable if using bamboo needles), but I do mostly love the end result aside from some pilling under the arms. My wife modeled it for me here, so I could get this photo.

        I did do some modifications for this top: instead of doing the increases spaced around the chest. I just did three rows of increases along the sleeve lines on either side of the front and either side of the back. This got my stitch count to match up with the lace patternâ€™s without having to worry about doing something special for the sleeve stitches, which I think is preferrable than having what look like mistakes on the most prominent area of the chest.
