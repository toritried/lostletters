        I was inspired by my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@minigru.studios">Kait</a> to whip up this small fish pouch from Noro yarn and Spincycle scraps. It ended up being really too large for my keys as I originally intended because I didn't read the pattern and thus thought only the body would be a pouch when the tail fin was actually part of the pouch too.

        I really like how the eye ball turned out with the dead little cross eye. I think it's extra silly and oversized, which makes the pouch look even funnier in real life.

        I finally knit a Stephen West shawl even if it's admittedly a lot more tame than his usual designs. This used up one skein of Spincycle Ghost Ranch that I fell in love with at the yarn shop and two balls of the maroon-colored yarn. I originally used a ground beef colored background color, but it completely erased the pink in the spincycle gradient yarn, which was a huge mistep on my part that forced me to rip out a ton of progress. The only upside from ripping out half the shawl is that I eventually became familiar with the 14+ row repeat in the pattern, so I could knit it without tracking where I was in the pattern.

        I originally intended for this to be a shawl I could wear over my workout clothes, so that no one over GVC could tell I hadn't changed out of my morning workout clothes; however, in my last apartment, I was mostly too warm to use it. Now that I'm in my new house, it's positively frosty in my office, so I've gotten a ton of use out of it due to sheer necessity.

        In July 2025, my friend joined me for a local yarn crawl around the city and convinced me to knit this cute harness. Unfortunately, what looked like a nice raspberry color in the store turned out looking like ground beef yarn in the daylight, so I'm not sure how much I'll be wearing this to be honest. The fit is good, but the pattern was written so opaquely, I struggled to guess what they meant a lot of the time. I won't be buying another pattern from this designer in the future even though there are some really cute designs. What a shame.

        In July 2025, I decided to use some Spincycle yarn scraps to make these gradient socks. I love how the left foot turned out, but I'm a little dissappointed that there is such a large yellow chunk on the right foot. That's the nature of using up undesirable scraps though--you have to give up a bit of control. The main color is a singly ply yarn, which isn't the best for hard-wearing socks, and I'm not sure if it has nylon in it for durability. It was yarn I've had in stash for 10 years, so I'm not confident that these will stand the test of time. My main modification was using the supremely stretchy Old Norwegian Cast On that I learned from the Ripple Bralette instead of a tighter long-tail cast on. I also used the Fish Lips Kiss Heel pattern instead of the heel as written in the pattern because I was getting weird holes along the sides.

        The only reason I wanted a labubu was to knit tiny clothing. Luckily, my wife's friend got a labubu for her birthday and was willing to have me knit a cardigan for it. This was made with Spincycle scraps I had in stash that I would never use for a garment myself, so it was essentially "free". The pattern was also generously free, so this didn't cost me anything to make essentially. #KnittingMath

        In June 2025, I finished my third Shona top by Irene Lin. It's made with <a target="_blank" href="https://hobbii.com/products/hp-1000996-tencel">Tencel Bamboo Fine, a yarn from Hobbii that is 60% bamboo rayon, 40% tencel</a> (a rayon fiber made from wood pulp), which creates a very cool, slippery drapey fabric that I really enjoy next to skin. It was a nightmare to knit with as it split easily and slid all over my slippery metal Addi interchangeable needles (avoidable if using bamboo needles), but I do mostly love the end result aside from some pilling under the arms. My wife modeled it for me here, so I could get this photo.

        I did do some modifications for this top: instead of doing the increases spaced around the chest. I just did three rows of increases along the sleeve lines on either side of the front and either side of the back. This got my stitch count to match up with the lace patternâ€™s without having to worry about doing something special for the sleeve stitches, which I think is preferrable than having what look like mistakes on the most prominent area of the chest.
