I wanted to start a log of the past iterations of the site, so I can look back on all the <strike>terrible code I've mucked about in</strike> good memories I've made!

<h2>Version 2: Lost in Space!  |  March 2023 - current</h2>
With this layout, I simplify the elements of my first layout, so I settled on modifying the background for the main content container based on <a target="_new" href="https://palemomos.neocities.org/cool-layouts/">Pale's gorgeous Glassy layout</a>. I've been totally on a space kick, playing the <a target="_new" href="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged">Starforged TTRPG</a>, reading Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey, and watching The Expanse, which is based on that book. Therefore, I think that probably explains why I went with the space background. It's hard to find something dark, but not too boring. At this point in time, I do not have an eye for web design at all, so I don't think I'll ever get to the point where I'll design a layout from scratch.

<b>Some highlights and notable changes:</b> 
* Started this page!
* Dark theme won't hurt my eyes at night 8D
* High-contrast text colors for better accessibility
* Lots of glowing for mouse-over links + my little hover bee entry point to my q*bee shrine
* Correcting some of my header styling issues

<h2>Version 1: Lace Letters  |  Oct 2022 - March 2023</h2>

This layout was from <a target="_blank" href="https://foollovers.com/">Fool Lovers</a>. They provided the lace header, lacy content container graphics and code, url hover sparkles, favicon, and bouncing sakura divider. I will always be extremely fond of this layout since it was the first one I tweaked to my liking to launch Lost Letters on Neocities. A lot of folks enjoyed the gorgeous pixel art based on the guestbook entries from that time.
