You can call me Lost (she/her) because that's part of the concept of this site, and it just feels fitting since I feel lost all the time being half-Japanese and living in Japan. „Çà„Çç„Åó„Åè„ÅäÈ°ò„ÅÑ„Åó„Åæ„Åô. 
<br>
<br>
To me, this site is like a stack of letters, discovered in a lunchbox that washed up on a distanct coast like in <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i> by Ruth Ozeki. 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/caicyo/art/Pixel-snufkin-794162961"><img src="/graphics/toy/snufkin_by_Caicyo.png" style="margin: 2px 4px 0 0;" align="left" title="click for artist"/></a>
The style and organization of this site hopefully conveys a sense of thought and effort akin to selecting a pretty letter set and fountain pen ink. 
Even though there is no way of knowing what you'll get out of reading these letters, I hope you take a look around and enjoy it. 
<br>
<br>
As for me, I started learning to code thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=waterfish57">Neopets</a> in ~2003, and I began <img src="/graphics/toy/avatar-collector-neopets.gif" style="margin: 5px 0 0 5px;" align="right" />to pour my heart into mediocre pixel art and website layouts drawn in MS Paint and Photoshop. 
I'm so glad I never let my dislike of my art stop me from participating in the pixel communities of that time, because I made so many good memories and learned a lot. 
<br>
<br>
Aside from what got me into web development, I'm <b>Type-A</b> and an <b>extrovert</b>, so I enjoy clean & tidy spaces, waking up early, having a plan + backup, accountability as well as making small talk with strangers, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.deviantart.com/fairypaws/art/steven-universe-pixels-free-to-use-539281573"><img src="/graphics/toy/pearl-fairypaws.png" align="left" style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;" title="I'm most like Pearl, but I wish I was like Garnet"/></a>ordering for the table, hanging out with people (<i>not my thoughts</i>), and making friends easily. 
Although I feel like I'm fiercely independent (moved to a different continent where I didn't speak the local language and didn't tell family or friends for 6 months), I hate being alone and my first impulse is to ask others for help instead of try to figure out things on my own‚Äî<i>maybe this is just an extrovert thing though?</i> 
For a better sense of my feelings towards specific things, let me leave you with a bunch of classic lists:

                        You're a little different and that's okay with them, and if you're smart it's okay with you too.

                        You value accomplishments and know you can get the job done, so don't be afraid to run out and make things happen.
