<h2>Hail & Well Met,</h2> 
I started informally teaching myself to code thanks to Neopets in ~2003, which inspired me <img src="/graphics/toy/avatar-collector-neopets.gif" style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;" align="left" />to pour my heart into subpar pixel art and website layouts drawn in MS Paint and Photoshop. I'm so glad I never let my frustrating mediocrity stop me from participating in the pixel communities of that time, because I made so many good memories (q*bee, Teahouse MB) and learned some basics of HTML, CSS, and PHP.

In the intervening decades, I thoroughly dismissed the idea of ever taking any of my hobbies like web development seriously, but I still brushed off my elementary coding skills a few times in addition to learning things like FTP to host my own site and domain, so I could participate in online TCGs, including <a target="_blank" href="https://tcg.fandom.com/wiki/Zest">Zest</a>. These were not like Pokemon or YuGiOh!, because <i>online trading</i> was the game. Through trading cards, you'd collect enough cards to master decks and level up. It used to be horrendously manual; however, I was recently shocked to find and subsequently became entirely consumed by newer, fully automated TCGs like <a target="_blank" href="https://heavenspell.la-impresion.org/TCG/">Trading Base</a>. Curiously, it seems like the TCG player base is still heavily female like the previous online spaces I've mentioned.
<br>
<br>
The boredom of the pandemic finally gave me the inspiration and judgement-free opportunity to explore those hobbies of yore again, leading me back to the threadbare remnants of the early internet I so enjoyed as a child. What started out as setting a goal to earn 10 million neopoints after all these years to achieve "ultimate riches" on Neopets quickly snowballed into discovering the yesterweb and web revival. All of a sudden, I was up until 2am, filled with a sense of urgency to pick back up as much as I could of the early internet of my childhood, which I felt like I was close to losing forever. That urgency inspired this website, so if it feels like an incoherent fever-dream, that's because it is.

Now that I've truly accepted that I'm just a goblin that likes weird stuff instead of someone who does HIIT six days a week before bottomless mimosa brunch, you can typically find me playing, watching, or listening to TTRPGs if I'm offline. I still haven't shed my tendency towards exercise, so I'm probably also working out for my stupid mental health and tracking it obsessively to earn <a target="_blank" href="https://garminbadges.com/">garmin connect badges</a>. I will seriously do anything for the simplest forms of gamification, it's stupid and sometimes dangerous. I also try to stay on top of my daily memory keeping, which involves excessive amounts of fountain pens, stickers, and washi tape.
