Tamagotchi became a fixation for me at the end of August 2023. My friend purchased the Uni, and I had to get in on the fun. Had I not been so driven by nostalgia thanks to making whole site, I probably could have resisted the pull of <a href="/virtual-pets/">yet another virtual pixel pet</a>, but here we are, taking care of another pet better than we take care of ourselves. 
<br>
<br>
I think there's something just so compelling about these cute characters, especially since the latest generation has distinct personalities. Even though the art style has changed a lot over the years, tamagotchi characters, regardless of generation, are instantly recognized as such. Furthermore, the astronomical prices of tamagotchi collabs with Sanrio and Disney show just how much power iconic characters can have. I am but a weak-willed fiend for Sanrio, so you can probably tell which tama I just couldn't resist adding to my collection below because I so badly wanted to play with the sanrio characters.

    I really didn't think I was going to get into tamagotchi as an adult because I remember the game part of the device was pretty dull when I was a kid. The brand has come a long way since the original generation of tamas, and now growing different characters is so fun! I also love to collect the decor and accessories to dress up my tama and their room. Like many other tamagotchi fans, I am hoping they release a different shell for this tamagotchi, ideally a transparent one.

    These are the various evolutions of my tama and tamapet from my first time running my Tamagotchi Uni. I was so eager to run this as the device had been recently released. I had just gotten back from a month in Europe, so I was extremely jet lagged and accidentally left my baby tama unattended for a while during a nap. She turned into a teftetchi, but I was still able to get a cutie adult tama from this evolution, so I consider the little neglect a happy accident. I love the final result of ‚ú®woopatchi‚ú®, my little pride mascot whose facial expression is a whole mood hehehe.

    August 22 was an eventful day, starting with love at first date and a proposal to shykutchi by woopatchi. They got busy immediately and made an egg, which hatched into yooyutchi. With some diligent care, he grew quickly into a shy little welcotchi, which has to be one of the cutest tamas in the whole game. I love welsh corgis so much, so I was overjoyed by getting this character who just constantly blushes and asks for cookies and jelly beans.

    This was a semi-impulsive purchase, but I'm so glad I found a decent price on a resale site because I was told anything under $200 USD is a good price for this version. I haven't actually run this tama yet because it's currently being shipped to me. I really wanted to get this tamagotchi because you can grow a sanrio character, then marry other tamagotchi original characters. The children will inherit hybrid physical traits from their sanrio and tamagotchi parents, and the number of different types of possible tamas for this generation of tamagotchi is truly astounding, especially when you consider just <a target="_blank" href="https://tamaplanet.com/charts/tamagotchi-meets-version-chart">the sheer number of base characters</a>. I really want to get a sweets version of the tamagotchi meets as well because the sweets and sanrio hybrid characters would be amazing!

    These are tamas I haven't played with yet because my friend is giving them to me this week, but I'm so excited to run my sanrio meets with this magical meets (the purple one) to create hybrid characters. I really wonder how many I can run concurrently without becoming overwhelmed. The middle tama is a tamagotchi P's (pronounced like piece in Japanese), which has a removable heart charm / piece that can be swapped with other charms for basically DLC content and characters. One of the more expensive pieces is the disney piece because it was the only collab tamagotchi has done with Disney. The tamagotchi on the right is a pink Pix Party, and it actually comes with a build-in camera! I'm going to have to take at least one photo and post it in this shrine regardless of how much it drains the battery.
