Tamagotchi became a fixation for me at the end of August 2023. My friend purchased the Uni, and I had to get in on the fun. Had I not been so driven by nostalgia thanks to making this whole site, I probably could have resisted the pull of <a href="/virtual-pets/">yet another virtual pixel pet</a>, but here we are, taking care of another pet better than we take care of ourselves. 
<br>
<br>
I think there's something just so compelling about these cute characters, especially since the latest generation has distinct personalities. Even though the art style has changed a lot over the years, tamagotchi characters, regardless of generation, are instantly recognized as such. Furthermore, the astronomical prices of tamagotchi collabs with Sanrio and Disney show just how much power iconic characters can have. I am but a weak-willed fiend for Sanrio, so you can probably tell which tama I just couldn't resist adding to my collection below because I so badly wanted to play with the sanrio characters.

    I really didn't think I was going to get into tamagotchi as an adult because I remember the game part of the device was pretty dull when I was a kid. The brand has come a long way since the original generation of tamas, and now growing different characters is so fun! I also love to collect the decor and accessories to dress up my tama and their room. Like many other tamagotchi fans, I am hoping they release a different shell for this tamagotchi, ideally a transparent one.

I had just gotten back from a month in Europe, so I was extremely jet lagged and accidentally left my child tama unattended for a while during a nap. She turned into a teftetchi, but I was still able to get a cutie adult tama from this evolution, so I consider the little neglect a happy accident. I love the final result of ‚ú®woopatchi‚ú®, my little pride mascot whose facial expression is a whole mood hehehe."><b>1st generation: woopatchi, queer & iconic</b></span>

I love welsh corgis so much, so I was overjoyed by getting this character who just constantly blushes and asks for cookies and jelly beans. I love that he got to play with the taiyaki-shaped Monatototchi tama pet in the garden all day. Unfortunately, I won too many arcade games and influenced the growth tree to get curltchi, so my dreams of getting Mametchi were completely dashed. Since I had to grind for money, I ended up forcing the evolution towards Kikitchi, our little monkey prince. I didn't love this character design, so as soon as he evolved, I married him off.">

    This was a semi-impulsive purchase, but I'm so glad I found a decent price on a resale site because I was told anything under $200 USD is a good price for this version. I really wanted to get this tamagotchi because you can grow a sanrio character, then marry other tamagotchi original characters. The children will inherit hybrid physical traits from their sanrio and tamagotchi parents, and the number of different types of possible tamas for this generation of tamagotchi is truly astounding, especially when you consider just <a target="_blank" href="https://tamaplanet.com/charts/tamagotchi-meets-version-chart">the sheer number of base characters</a>. I really want to get a sweets version of the tamagotchi meets as well because the sweets and sanrio hybrid characters would be amazing!

XD It was much more involved than the Tamagotchi Uni characters; however, it was entirely worth all the effort to max out hunger and happiness because it turned into Yumehotchi, which is a little ghosty girl with a star crown in the pan pride colors !!! I was so excited that I jumped up immediately to run over to my girlfriend and show her. This device was so worth it. The next day, we got hanbunkotchi, which is quite a cute little split-colored tama followed by her final form: Lovelitchi, a sweet little bunny tama that likes to run around the room, smiling.">

    My friend dove deep into the rabbit hole of tamagotchi, but quickly gave it up. I am so grateful they gave me these tamas and a phone capable of a specific band of infrared for connecting to the P's tama all for the low price of ¬•12,000 JPY ($82.49 USD equivalent at date of purchase)!

     I really wonder how many I can run concurrently without becoming overwhelmed. The middle tama is a tamagotchi P's (pronounced like "piece" in Japanese), which has a removable heart charm piece that can be swapped with other charms for DLC items and characters. One of the more expensive pieces is the disney piece because it was the only collab tamagotchi has done with Disney. The tamagotchi on the right is a pink Pix Party, and it actually comes with a build-in camera! I'm going to have to take at least one photo and post it in this shrine regardless of how much it drains the battery.

        On my first tamagotchi hunt through secondhand stores with my girlfriend, I found this angelgotchi with the original glittery hard cases! It's such an iconic shell and in my favorite color, so I just couldn't pass it up. 
        The hard case had some sharpie on it, but I was able to remove it completely with just a couple swipes of an alcohol wipe thanks to some advice on the internet!

Out of all the colors, pink is definitely my favorite, which is good because white seems to be the most expensive version.
