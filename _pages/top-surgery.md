When I was preparing for double incision top surgery in Japan, I couldn't find any personal accounts of similar experiences in English, so I wanted to share my experience in case others want to pursue a similar path. I'm happy to share further details and answer questions from anyone who is considering top surgery in Japan, so, if that's you, just reach out with a way to get in touch privately in my guestbook. In terms of what you can expect here, I won't be sharing any photos and additional content warnings will apply to specific sections.

Before we get started, I want to put a few disclaimers and dedications. I never ever would have been able to do this alone. If it weren't for my dearest friend and dauntless trans ally who translated Japanese at my consultations, learned more about top surgery than I ever did, double checked drug interactions, and more, I never would have had the courage nor ability to live so comfortably in my body. I am wholly indebted to you. I also owe my smooth recovery to my wife who was my ever-attentive and loving caregiver. We will always be there for each other, and I am so grateful.

## Consultations

My initial consultation was with Nagumo Clinic, the most famous clinic group to provide gender affirming surgeries in Japan, so it was decidedly more expensive than the clinic I ultimately I chose (~$2,000 USD / ¬•300,000 JPY difference). In the initial consultation, I was seeking a breast reduction, but I was told a breast reduction could only remove 60% of my breast tissue, which was a huge disappointment. The only way I could get down to an A cup, which was what I wanted at the time, was to basically get close by undergoing a full mastectomy or getting top surgery. Later that night after the consultation, my nonbinary egg cracked, and I felt certain that I wanted top surgery even if that meant I was going to have larger scars than I was previously okay with.

My friends looked up additional clinics offering top surgery, and one clinic specifically called out top surgery for FTX, which is a term that refers to Female To X Gender transitions with X Gender being a Japanese term that's similar to nonbinary. Therefore, I was particularly keen on meeting with this clinic since I felt like I would be understood and respected there.

## Pre-surgery (CW: eating disorder and dieting mention)

I ended up choosing the FTX-friendly clinic, and they were very thorough in going over the risks with me to ensure I gave my fully informed consent for the procedure. There was about a two month waiting period because I needed to wait for the anesthesiologist to be available as my surgery was considered "high-risk" due to my weight. The doctor offered to postpone the surgery until I could lose 10kg (22 lbs), but I didn't want to trigger an eating disorder relapse by engaging in a crash diet just to get top surgery ASAP. I was also relatively confident about my cardiovascular health given that I'd been consistently running at least 5km 2-3 times per week for 4+ months prior to the surgery. I'm also a mostly whole foods plant based vegan on a decently healthy diet, and my extensive blood and urine panels from my annual health exam days before my surgery showed that I was in ideal ranges for everything from cholesterol, creatine, and more. Given the risk of clotting, I was told to stop taking birth control one month before surgery, which I actually did for two months prior, and I also made sure to prioritize my running in addition to my 12,000 daily steps to get myself into peak physical condition regardless of my weight.

In the two months waiting period prior to surgery, my mind flip-flopped a lot on whether or not this was the right decision for me. I was extremely worried I would die during the procedure because it was "high risk", but I looked it up and basically it was a 1:500,000 chance that I'd die due to anesthesia, so I felt more calm after that. I did write up a will just in case and fretted a lot about how much my wife would have to do on my behalf if I died.

## The Day Before Surgery

My wife made a large pot of lentil soup for me, filled with fiber for the post-anesthesia constipation and protein to help me heal after surgery. I pureed that to ensure I could drink it through a straw if my throat was extremely sore after intubation. I packed a fluffy and warm robe, a change of undergarments, 4 bagels, 4 servings of pureed lentil soup, and vitamin C throat lozenges. I also laid out my clothes, a snap-closure coat, zip-up stretchy hoodie, and leggings that would be easy to get on after surgery.

## Post-operation

The surgery went smoothly. Because I was larger than their standard patient, they reserved four hours for surgery, two hours for recovery. I took all of that time. Once I was ready to get off the operating table, they wrapped my chest extremely tightly and moved me to a recovery recliner chair, where my wife and best friend could sit with me as I recovered. After two hours, I slowly shuffled to the nearby hotel they recommended for me to stay at overnight until I got my painful drains taken out the next day. My wife and friend picked up extra-long straws so I could sip sports drinks, water, and soup comfortably. I was given three pain killers and three anti-nausea pills, which I consumed in pairs as per their instructions over 6-hour intervals. I was also given two-days-worth of twice daily antibiotics. I was warned that I had to watch out for massive swelling the size of a softball or grapefruit on my chest (it never happened thankfully). Sleeping upright was difficult and a bit painful, but the extra pillows from the hotel helped considerably.

## The Next Day / Removal of Drains

I managed to get some decent sleep and down quite a large serving of lentil soup and 1.75 bagels, but my appetite was still low. I managed some more soup for breakfast before we went back to the clinic to take out my drains. It was immediately more comfortable, but I was freaked out to see the sheer size of the incision sites that spanned from the center of my chest all the way under my arms and around my ribs. They taught me how to dress the wounds and told me that the bandaged gauze over drain holes should be removed and replaced with a waterproof bandage whenever I take my first shower. I could shower that day if I wanted. Additionally, the healing tape I was given for dressing the incisions was only for healing the wound--it wasn‚Äôt tape for stabilizing like what is commonly given in US, so I only got two changes of tape. I also bought a second compression band so I could change them out and wash them as needed since it was difficult to wash and apply deodorant to my armpits. Overall, both my friend and I were in shock at how chill and less complex this process was compared to what we'd both read online from primarily US-based sources.

## Recovery At Home

My friend drove me home after my appointment to take my drains out, and my team of caring friends hung out with me that day, picking up food so my wife could take a break and ensuring I didn't have to lift a finger for anything I needed. It was extremely kind of them. We quickly got prepared with plenty of easy meals like frozen low-sodium veg pizza and vegan protein shakes to make it easier on my wife/caregiver. I was able to go to the bathroom unassisted, but I couldn't have showered by myself even after three days. It was also extremely helpful for her to prepare my food and help me make the couch comfortable for sleeping up-right. I don't know how people could manage recovering alone.
