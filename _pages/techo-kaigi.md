## My Guide to Techo Kaigi

Techo kaigi (æ‰‹å¸³ä¼šè­°, planner meeting in Japanese) is basically an opportunity to reflect on your planning/journaling system. It looks different for everyone, but I've been using planners for more than 10 years, so I designed this exercise with some examples for folks who either want to start using planners for the first time or are unsatisfied with their current planner lineup:

1. **Define Personal Tracking Needs** (what's in scope?)
   - ðŸ“… Events / Key Dates
     - Birthdays
     - Trips
   - ðŸ’ª Health
     - Food log
     - Sleep stats
     - Exercise
   - ðŸ“š Learning
     - Lessons / Classes
   - ðŸ¤” Reflection
     - What did I do for my future self today? How did I respect myself today?
     - Mood
     - Gratitude
     - Major purchases
   - âœ– **Things I do not want to track in a planner** (what's out of scope and why?):
     - Shared life aspects like trip planning, cleaning schedule - These things need shared visibility
     - Work-related professional development - I need to divide work and life
     - Habit tracking - I always fail at tracking this in paper planners
2. **Define Ideal Techo Specs**
   - Hard Requirements: List the features and how they serve you (do not consider techo without these)
     - Dated to keep me accountable
     - Grid paper for neat handwriting
     - A6 space or less for a single day to avoid having blank pages
   - Nice to have Features
     - Not TRP - all my fp inks forever smear
     - The fewer notes pages, the better because I only need one for pen/ink testing
     - Half year / avec style to cut down on deco chonk and increase portability
     - A5 or A6 size since I have so many covers I need to use
3. **Evaluate Planner Models** - List out pros & cons for each model you're considering
4. **Sort Tracking Needs into Spreads** - Using the list from Step 1, slot these into the different spreads of the techo you picked from Step 3 (ex: track trip dates on the monthly spread, log meals on the daily spreads)
