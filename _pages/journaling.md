These are a collection of powerful introspection and journaling practices I use constantly, and I hope they help you if you want to start or enhance your journaling practice. As with anything, feel free to take what resonates, and leave the rest.

### My Weekly Reflection Template
At the start of the week, I set intentions (ex: do 1 thing that scares me, finish 1 book), then I reflect at the end of the week by asking myself these questions:  
1. What were my wins?  
2. What am I grateful for?  
3. What's not working and why?  
4. What am I avoiding?  
5. What will I do differently next week?  
  
Questions 1 and 2 get me in a good mindset before diving into the harder questions (3-5) that really challenge me to improve my approach and stay focused on progress towards longer-term projects.

### The Five Whys
In order to understand the cause of my behavior or feelings, I ask myself *why* I behaved or felt a certain way at least five times until the root cause is revealed. This often helps me diffuse an intense feeling so I can figure out how I can address it. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">The Five Whys technique</a> isn't typically used for this, but I find it to be really helpful, personally. It is commonly covered in introductions to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma">Lean Six Sigma</a> if you're curious about processes related to enterprise manufacturing.
