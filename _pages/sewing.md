        In June 2025, I sewed my first ever garment: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1792896986/the-juniper-dress-pdf-sewing-pattern">the Juniper Dress by Tiana Herring</a>! It was described as an adventurous beginner pattern, so I learned more than anticipated while making it. My friend lent me their sewing machine and expertise, which made this project actually feasible. I was shocked at how long it took to piece the paper printed pattern pieces together (1.5 hours), cut them out (45 min), cut out my fabric (2 hours total for muslin and real fabric), semi-construct the mock up (4 hours), and then sew the dress for real (5 hours). I'm glad I learned and am no longer too intimidated by sewing, but I probably should have just gotten <a target="_blank" href="https://shopnoble.com/collections/utility-dresses?srsltid=AfmBOorgWBlcHLSeRH9-x3R8cdUfO7DVqdGYaYc9NvdmcLcdMIH6g-ib">the original Nobel Utility Dress</a> because my supplies came out to $102.11, which is only about $80 less than the real, professionally made real thing... At least mine has a custom length tailored to my preferences, I guess?
