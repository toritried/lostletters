<h2>FAQ</h2>
<img src="/graphics/layout/v1_laceletter/purple-star.gif"/><b> Can I use the template without joining the club?</b>
<br>Yes, you are welcome to use it for any purpose!
<br>
<img src="/graphics/layout/v1_laceletter/purple-star.gif"/><b> How is a pixel "club" different from a pixel "clique"?</b>
<br>I use them interchangably, but I just prefer "club" because it sounds more inclusive. 
<br>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

This is a pixel club tribute to <b>Teahouse MB</b>, a kawaii pixel art forum that no longer exists. Teahouse MB provided a teacup template for folks to create their own unique teacup designs. Artists would then allow a limited number of people to collect the design on a first-come-first-serve basis, usually limiting it to the first 10-20 people who posted on the thread.

<br>
*note:* I created the template for the Afternoon Pixel Club from scratch since I didn't have a copy of the original from Teahouse MB.
