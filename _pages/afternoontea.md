This is a pixel club tribute to <b>Teahouse MB</b>, a kawaii pixel art forum that no longer exists. Teahouse MB provided a teacup template for folks to create their own unique teacup designs. Artists would then allow a limited number of people to collect the design on a first-come-first-serve basis, usually limiting it to the first 10-20 people who posted on the thread. 
<img src="/graphics/toy/emoticons/shocked-moomin.gif" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 0 7px;" > 
<i>Note:</i> I created the template for the Afternoon Pixel Club from scratch since I didn't have a copy of the original from Teahouse MB.
<br>
<br>
<i>Update (2023.04.10)</i>: I actually found Joanne's website (the owner of TeahouseMB) who still has a collection <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pausedlife.com/webmiss/me-on-thmb">here</a> as well as <a target="_blank" href="http://caz.pausedlife.com/Me/BBS.html">Caz's collection</a>, so please give those collections a click and get inspired.
