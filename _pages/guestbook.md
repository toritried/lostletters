                Hi! Hope you're doing well. I just wanted to share that I relate a lot to your most recent blog update. Me and "future me" almost feels like the latter invited me to their house but didn't tell how to get there lol. I even had the same video recommended to me a couple days before you shared your post. I really like your plan/takeaways specifically; I wish you the best!! Sorry if this is a weird message to send, but also I wanted you to know you're heard.

                Hello! Âàù„ÇÅ„Åæ„Åó„Å¶ÔºÅ I found your site by searching for "stationery" on neocities and I was surprised at how similar we were! I also lived in Japan for many years and just recently returned to the US. I wasn't vegan, but as a vegetarian, I understand the struggles of ordering or even finding vegetarian food in the first place. I don't regret moving back, but I really really miss buying stationery off mercari, especially those uniball ones haha.
                <br>
                Anyway, we had so much in common that I had to reach out! Let me know if you want any Tokyo-insider knowledge on vegetarian places and little stationery shops!

                Hi! I read your post about crocheting- I'm excited to see how your top turns out, your yarn choice looks lovely! Also I would love to be a learning accountability buddy, I've been in a slump with drawing/painting lately, but found a video on composition (which I really struggle with) that inspired me. I think it would be fun to have weekly check ins :-)

                Thanks so much! I made this guestbook by creating a <a target="_blank" href="https://formspree.io">Formspree form</a>, which emails me with the guestbook messages y'all submit on this page. I then transpose the messages into code for this page and push it live, so the submissions aren't immediate. All the styling is just CSS I wrote, which you can view either by inspecting the page or checking out my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/toritried/lostletters">public GitHub repo for the site</a>. Also, after you submitted this question, I added message filtering using a little JS and following <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_elements.asp">this w3schools tutorial for filtering elements</a>.

            I'm so glad he got more time to shine and develop in the later seasons of The Expanse. He's really standout alongside the best dressed Chrisjen Avasarala. I'm almost finished with the first book in the series, and Amos didn't leave as much of an impression there compared to the show, so kudos to Wes Chatham for such a great performance.
