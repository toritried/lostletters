    Tastes like beer, because it's beer, but in a teacup that's part beer mug

    I'm so glad he got more time to shine and develop in the later seasons of The Expanse. He's really standout alongside the best dressed Chrisjen Avasarala. I'm almost finished with the first book in the series, and Amos didn't leave as much of an impression there compared to the show, so kudos to Wes Chatham for such a great performance.

    I tried a lot of different designs for the site navigation before I created something I was happy with, so I really appreciate your comment. I loved your portfolio full of so many awesome dnd characters. :D
