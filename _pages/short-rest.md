    Welcome, weary traveler. You have triumphantly made it to A Short Rest, a DIY mental spa of sorts for those who just need a little break or boost. Adventuring brings all sorts here, so take what you find valuable and leave the rest. This magical little destination is one you can return to as many times as you like whenever and wherever you are thanks to the powerful enchantment of a web weaver (provided you have a speaking stone or other enchanted device that can connect to the internet). Please note that although a short rest can be extremely helpful in times of need, <b>this is not a substitute for profession medical advice</b>. There is a <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/find-help.htm">directory of international mental health helplines</a> should you need a powerful healer or greater restoration.

    Now, I'd like to recommend this criminally underappreciated bard: Sammy Rae & The Friends. Their EP, The Good Life, is sure to lift your spirits. These songs are enchanted with main character energy and evoke a sense of skipping through a summer block party in New York city during golden hour, if that's your thing. I assure you that it's nearly impossible to frown while skipping. I recommend you listen in order, but this old music player can be a little finnicky sometimesâ€”just ask it nicely, press the play button, and pray for your hand that it hasn't been replaced with a mimic.

      As you move on from the music player, you notice a few folks milling about as well as an array of books on a shelf in the back corner. Your eyes land on a jovial giant sloth wearing a green cloak. They smile and motion for you to come closer. As you get closer, they twist their wrist upward to reveal a glowing orb in the claws of their left hand.
      <br>
      <br>
      "This orb provides incantations you can try when you're in a difficult spot. Take a look!"

<h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://habitica.com/"><b>Habitica</b></a> (website) - earn EXP, HP, equipment, pets, mounts, potions, and more as you complete your habits, daily routines, and to-do list. You can even join in on party quests to defeat bosses! It's such a clever and robust RPG system that gamifies getting things done. It has helped me reframe tedious, procrastinated chores into tasks that I am eager to do first thing when I wake up for the points. I'm a make number go up goblin though, so your milage may vary.

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytools.com/professional/techniques/socratic-questioning-socratic-dialogue/"><b>Socratic Questioning</b></a> (mental intervention) - I was introduced to this tool in therapy. Asking myself, "What evidence do I have to feel this way?" quickly diffused the intensity and duration of anxiety attacks to the point that I no longer suffer from anxiety regularly. For me, it works because, in answering the question, I always come to the realization that my anxiety is unfounded because I actually have a lot of evidence to the contrary.</li>
