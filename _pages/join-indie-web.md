<h1>Join the Indie Web</h1>
<p>
    This page was created in response to the <a target="_blank" href="https://tilde.32bit.cafe/~hermit/community_jam_3/">32-bit Cafe's 1st Anniversary Code Jam</a> prompt: <i>What has creating a website done for you?</i>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    To me, the <a target="_blank" href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web</a> carries forth the incredibly valuable and rewarding <i>Participatory Culture</i> of Web 2.0. In Henry Jenkins' 2009 white paper entitled, <i>Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century</i>, the paper describes a participatory culture as one:
    <ol>
        <li>With relatively low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement</li>
        <li>With strong support for creating and sharing one's creations with others</li>
        <li>With some type of informal mentorship whereby what is known by the most experienced is passed along to novices</li>
        <li>Where members believe that their contributions matter</li>
        <li>Where members feel some degree of social connection with one another (at the least they care what other people think about what they have created)</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    While Participatory Culture has been around since before the internet, I haven't found myself in any other communities outside of the indie web where I'm able to experience it. All of these elements of Participatory Culture resonate deeply with me when I think of what creating a website has done for me, so let me wax poetic about a few in the hopes that it'll inspire you to get in on all this fun we're having. If you're already sold, check out <a href="/resources/">these resources to get started on making your own website</a>.

<h2>Skill Building</h2>
<p>
    Creating a website has proven to my inner child that I am more capable than I ever thought I could be. While there aren't any technical marvels on my site, I am extremely proud that I've learned and implemented code that my ten year-old self would have entirely dismissed as being far too complex to figure out. I've also gotten comfortable with using some JavaScript and figuring out how to use Jekyll as my static site generator, so I can easily build my static site on Neocities instead of using PHP like I did as a kid. I also have to give a hat tip to my loving wife who has generously lent her decade of web development experience to ensure I've never been stuck on a coding challenge for very long.

<h2>Expressing my Uniqueness</h2>
<p>
    When I was young and creating my early websites, I just wanted to have yet another cute pixel site and fit in with the crowd. Some twenty years later, the guiding principle behind my website is to <b>make what only I can make</b>. My website is a celebration of my uniqueness, reflecting my lived experience of the niche corners of the web that I can revive; my deep passion for planning and stationery; my trans experience I share to help others navigate their own transitions; and so much more.
</p>
<h2>Finding & Building Community</h2>

<p>
    For the first time for me in over a decade, I have multiple fun and active places to hang out on the internet that revolve around web development, including Mastodon, Neocities, and the 32-bit cafe <a target="_blank" href="https://32bit.cafe/discord/">Discord</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe/">Discourse</a>. To give back to these communities, I've tried to be an active participant, create a webring, and help put on several 32-bit cafe community events. Every time I get involved or share more of myself through my personal website and these adjacent communities, I've been rewarded handsomely with kind and encouraging messages from like-minded adults. These spaces have expanded where I feel safe to express and be myself, and I couldn't be more grateful.
