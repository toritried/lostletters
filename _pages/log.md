    <h2>January Updates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ran 8km for the first time since college</li>
        <li>held my first journaling meetup in Japan</li>
        <li>my egg cracked after going for a top surgery consultation--I'm nonbinary!</li>
        <li>finished an eight-week running training plan, shaving off five minutes from my 5km; went from running 5km in 41:41 to 36:41</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
    ★★★★☆ Singles Inferno Season 3 - everyone is super hot and entertaining, but the show is painfully hetero
    <br>
    ★★★☆☆ Love is Blind Japan - The show started out on a high, but then makes you dislike almost every male character by the end of the season; weird structure for a show
    <br>
    ★★★☆☆ Palworld - It's everything I like about Lego Fortnite, Breath of The Wild, and Pokemon
    <br>
    ★★★★☆ Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea by Rita Chang-Eppig - adventure story about a legendary Chinese pirate queen
    <br>
    ★★★★★ Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries - curmudgeonly professor goes on a trip to study faerie folklore, easy read and entertaining too
    <br>
    ★★★★★ Emily Wilde's Map of the Otherlands - A pleasantly entertaining fairy tale fantasy sequel featuring a lovable anti-social and introverted main character

        <ul>
            <li>finished my mohair cloud Ranunculus sweater (pictured)</li>
            <li>went back to the US to get <a href="/2024/02/16/slice-of-life-marriage">married on February 12, 2024</a>; very chill, no frills</li>
            <li>spent a lot of the month very worried about top surgery</li>
            <li>really enjoyed myself at the new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamlab.art/e/borderless-azabudai/">TeamLab Borderless exhibit</a></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
        ★★★★★ Wingspan - A simpler boardgame with a ton of depth, still haven't figured out optimal strategies despite having played a lot

    <h2>March Updates</h2>
    <div style="overflow: hidden;">
        <img src="/graphics/blog/terrazzo.jpg" style="width: 45%; min-width: 200px; float: right; border-radius: 1em; margin: 0 .3em;" alt="Person in a knit sweater holding a cup of tea at a wooden table." title="Sidewalk Chalk Terrazzo Sweater"/>
        <ul>
            <li>cropped my hair super short for the first time since the pandemic</li>
            <li>completed my second running training plan, running a new PR: 34:46 for 5km!</li>
            <li>I underwent <a href="/top-surgery/">top surgery on March 15</a>, which took every ounce of bravery</li>
            <li>finished my Sapphic Brooklyn Raglan Lite sweater</li>
            <li>finished my Sidewalk Chalk Terrazzo Sweater (pictured)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Entertainment</h2>
        ★★☆☆☆ The Gilded Age Seasons 1 & 2 - an American version of Downton Abbey that didn't measure up in anyway. The costuming was whack, and the writing wasn't nearly as sharp and witty as the original. The cast stories all felt disjointed
        <br>
        ★★☆☆☆ Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury (機動戦士ガンダム 水星の魔女) - we had high hopes for this yuri anime, but I found the main character extremely juvenile and not endearing nor compelling
        <br>
        ★★★★☆ Dune 2 - No major challenges, negative character development, but great sound design
        <br>
        ★★☆☆☆ The Boy and the Heron (君たちはどう生きるか) - The film seemed to convey the simple message that you cannot dwell in grief forever, but it went about that for far too long
        <br>
        ★★★★★ Polysecure by Jessica Fern - really helpful to reference for how attachment styles impact polyamory, what to watch out for, etc
        <br>
        ★★★★☆ <a target="_blank" href="https://vill4in.bandcamp.com/album/--10">우주해일 by 암호</a> - atmospheric, cosmic/space lofi chiptune track to disassociate to, which I discovered in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utopiadistrict.com/articles/2023-vaporwave-selections/">this great vaporwave roundup</a>
