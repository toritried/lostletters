<h1>How I got started with TTRPGs</h1>
<p>
    Most people are shocked when I tell them I started playing tabletop role-playing games &#40;TTRPGs&#41; online with complete strangers on <a target="_new" href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20.net</a>. But, I think it's important to keep in mind that I didn't have any openly nerdy close friends until 2018, so no one was inviting me to play fun stuff like D&D. I had to find that all on my own, far later in life than I should have.
</p>
<p>
    At the start of 2018, I saw a recommendation online to listen to Season 1 of a podcast called <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_Zone">The Adventure Zone (TAZ)</a>. I couldn't get enough of it, and I even managed to get tickets to see a live recording of the podcast when I lived in the US. Although I stopped listening after Campaign 1, I couldn't stop thinking about the magic, fun, and creativity of TTRPGs. This original song from the podcast will never fail to make those feelings stir again:

    Before I even finished the first arc of Campaign 1 of TAZ, I began scouring my extended friend group for a DM and fellow players. Every bone in my body hummed with excitement at the idea of collaboratively telling a stupid hilarious fantasy story with friends. It took a while to actually get the in-person group running regularly, so, in the meantime, I turned to virtual tabletops to get a feel for RPGs. I swallowed my initial nerves and joined several strangers in a multi-session <a target="_new" href="https://evilhat.com/product/blades-in-the-dark/">Blades in the Dark</a> game as well as a D&D one-shot for beginners. 
</p>
<p>
    Looking back, I was truly unhinged by how badly I wanted to play any TTRPGs, but I have zero regrets. Despite perpetually being the only female player, I had nothing but great experiences in every beginner-friendly game I joined on Roll20, and I encourage people to keep an open-mind about pursuing this route, especially if you don't have friends you can play with in-person as regularly as your TTRPG-loving heart may desire.
