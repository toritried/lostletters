# Translating a Goal into a System

These are the steps I follow to break my goals into next steps and habits that I track in my planner. The process is informed by <a target="_blank" href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">James Clear's Atomic Habits</a>, psych research on goal setting, and my own professional experience. Feel free to follow and tweak these steps if it suits you.

<b>Step 1. Define Goals</b>: Come up with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals#:~:text=What%20are%20SMART%20goals%3F,within%20a%20certain%20time%20frame.">SMART goals</a> for different domains of your life. Here are a few example domains to spark some ideas.

<b>Step 2. Rank</b> your list of goals according to your priorities.
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3. Milestones</b>: Break the goal down into milestones. Milestones are major accomplishments or key events or deliverables along your goal's timeline. These are moments that you can celebrate along the way to mark significant progress towards your goal.
<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4. Next Steps</b>: For the first milestone of every prioritized goal, list out the next steps you need to take to get you to that milestone. Eventually, you'll want to do this for all the following milestones too, but focus on the first one for each goal for now. Categorize these steps with the following questions:
<ul>
    <li>Which of these next steps can be started right now? Consider starting on those right after this exercise to maintain momentum.</li>
    <li>Which need to be scheduled for a specific day in the future? Can you slot those into your calendar or set up a recurring reminder on your phone right now?</li>
    <li>Which next steps are recurring? Consider these as new habits.</li>
</ul>
**Step 5. Focus**: Now that you have a more complete picture of what these goals will entail, note down the level of effort each goal will take to complete. These can be rough estimations as even rough estimations will help you understand if youâ€™re taking on too much. If all your highest priority goals are very high effort, consider if you have the bandwidth to take those on. Pare down your list of goals to only the most essential ones.
<br>
<br>
**Step 6. Form <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065260106380021">Implementation Intentions</a>**: For any habits that still remain, write down as much detail as you can about these next steps. What is the exact time you will complete that habit? How exactly will you ensure you're prepared to complete that habit?
<blockquote>Example: What route will you take to get to the gym? What outfit will you wear? When will you pack your gym bag? What sets and reps will you do? Make this visualization as vivid and detailed as possible. Anticipate issues that might come up like needing to launder your gym clothes. How will you deal with that?</blockquote>
**Step 7. Get Help**: What or who can help you complete your next steps more easily? How can you get this help? Record your approach to obtaining help as a next step and consider if you can start it right now or need to wait for a specific date and time to get started.
<br>
<br>
**Step 8. Take Action**: Complete the next steps that are immediately actionable. Add the ones that can be scheduled for a specific time into your calendar of choice (I use my Hobonichi Cousin's weekly layout to give each next step a specific date and time). Keep a list of the ones you're waiting on and consider reaching out to bump things if possible. I keep this outstanding list as a tip-in (a memo sheet that is affixed to my planner with washi tape) on my weekly layout, so I remember to check in on it regularly.
<br>
<br>
**Step 9. Weekly To-Do List**: Likely, you'll have some new habits you'll need to do on a daily or weekly basis, so create a template weekly to-do list that's pre-populated with all of those habits that power your "system" as James Clear likes to call it.
<br>
<br>
**Step 10. Check in**: Periodically review your goals and next steps. Are the goals still serving you or do you have different priorities now? Are the next steps actually actionable and making meaningful progress towards your goals or do you need to create new next steps? Be honest with yourself and keep at it.
