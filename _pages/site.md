<h2>Technical Notes</h2>
My static site is generated by <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I am hosted by <a target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>. I push my code from my computer to Neocities with  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">Bret Comnesâ€™ deploy-to-neocities workflow</a>, and I followed <a target="_blank" href="https://jonathanchang.org/blog/deploying-your-static-site-to-neocities-using-github-actions/">this guide to set that up</a>. For the non-technical, Jekyll-curious, <a href="/2022/11/02/jekyll.html">I wrote out every single step I took to set up Jekyll for this site</a> as a complete beginner, including creating a Github account.

<h2>Past Layouts</h2>
I wanted to start a log of the past iterations of the site, so I can look back on all the <strike>terrible code I've written</strike> good memories I've made!

<h2>ðŸš€ Version 2: Lost in Space!  |  March 2023 - current</h2>
With this layout, I simplified the elements of my first layout using the body styling from <a target="_new" href="https://palemomos.neocities.org/cool-layouts/">Pale's gorgeous Glassy layout</a>. I've been totally on a space kick, playing <a  href="/starforged/">Starforged</a>, reading Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey, and watching The Expanse, which is based on that book. I think that probably explains why I went with the space background. It's hard to find something dark, but not too boring.

<h2>ðŸŽ€ Version 1: Lace Letters  |  Oct 2022 - March 2023</h2>

This layout was adapted from a template by <a target="_blank" href="https://foollovers.com/">Fool Lovers</a>. They provided the lace header, lacy content container graphics and code, url hover sparkles, favicon, and bouncing sakura divider. I will always be extremely fond of this layout since it was the first one I tweaked to my liking to launch Lost Letters on Neocities. A lot of folks enjoyed the gorgeous pixel art based on the guestbook entries from that time.
