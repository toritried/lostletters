<h2>Past Layouts</h2>
I wanted to start a log of the past iterations of the site, so I can look back on all the <i><strike>terrible code I've written</strike></i> good memories I've made!
<br>
<br>
<h3>ðŸŽ€ Version 1: Lace Letters  |  Oct 2022 - March 2023</h3>

</a>
This layout was adapted from a template by <a target="_blank" href="https://foollovers.com/">Fool Lovers</a>. They provided the lace header, lacy content container graphics and code, url hover sparkles, favicon, and bouncing sakura divider. I will always be extremely fond of this layout since it was the first one I tweaked to my liking to launch Lost Letters on Neocities. A lot of folks enjoyed the gorgeous pixel art based on the guestbook entries from that time.

* Designed my beloved dropdown menu bar
* Major content sections: q*bee shrine, confessions, stationery

<h3>ðŸš€ Version 2: Lost in Space!  |  March 2023 - October 2023</h3>
With this layout, I simplified the elements of my first layout using the body styling from <a target="_new" href="https://palemomos.neocities.org/cool-layouts/">Pale's gorgeous Glassy layout</a>. I've been totally on a space kick, playing <a  href="/starforged/">Starforged</a>, reading Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey, and watching The Expanse, which is based on that book. I think that probably explains why I went with the space background. It's hard to find something dark, but not too boring.
<br>
* Added this page (Mar '23), TTRPG section (Mar '23), Health section (May '23), reworked my toybox into a semi-shrine (Aug '23), tamagotchi shrine (Aug '23)
* High-contrast text colors for better accessibility
* <a target="_blank" href="https://linktr.ee/muk_monsalve">Mariela Monsalv</a> - creator of my body font (Asul)

<h3>ðŸŽƒ Version 3: 3-column throwback |  October 2023 - current</h3>
I have wanted to create a vintage-style 3-column layout for the longest time. I still don't think the left sidebar's content justifies its prominence, but I just wanted to have fun with making a 3-column responsive layout. The mobile and small screens revert to the single column layout of previous layouts, making it quite easy to adapt my old light and dark modes to the new structure. With this change, I also introduced two new layouts: spoopy and purple plaid. I coded the purple layout listening to The Crane's Pain Hasn't Hit Me on repeat. Such a vibe.

<h2>Technical Notes</h2>
My static site is generated by <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I am hosted by <a target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>. I push my code from my computer to Neocities with  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">Bret Comnesâ€™ deploy-to-neocities workflow</a>, and I followed <a target="_blank" href="https://jonathanchang.org/blog/deploying-your-static-site-to-neocities-using-github-actions/">this guide to set that up</a>. For the non-technical, Jekyll-curious, <a href="/2022/11/02/jekyll.html">I wrote out every single step I took to set up Jekyll for this site</a> as a complete beginner, including creating a Github account.
