<h2>About Lost Letters</h2>
I intended for this site to be like a lunchbox full of letter by a stranger, which you discovered washed up on a distant shore like in <i>A Tale for the Time Being</i> by Ruth Ozeki. Even though there is no way of knowing what you'll get out of reading these letters, I hope you take a look around and enjoy them.

<h2>Past Layouts</h2>
I wanted to start a log of the past iterations of the site, so I can look back on all the <strike>terrible code I've written</strike> good memories I've made!

<h2>ðŸš€ Version 2: Lost in Space!  |  March 2023 - current</h2>
With this layout, I simplified the elements of my first layout using the body styling from <a target="_new" href="https://palemomos.neocities.org/cool-layouts/">Pale's gorgeous Glassy layout</a>. I've been totally on a space kick, playing <a  href="/starforged/">Starforged</a>, reading Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey, and watching The Expanse, which is based on that book. I think that probably explains why I went with the space background. It's hard to find something dark, but not too boring.

This layout was adapted from a template by <a target="_blank" href="https://foollovers.com/">Fool Lovers</a>. They provided the lace header, lacy content container graphics and code, url hover sparkles, favicon, and bouncing sakura divider. I will always be extremely fond of this layout since it was the first one I tweaked to my liking to launch Lost Letters on Neocities. A lot of folks enjoyed the gorgeous pixel art based on the guestbook entries from that time.
