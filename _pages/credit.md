<h2>Site Credits and Attribution</h2>
This is a collection of wonderful people / places / things that helped me create this site. Attribution is important to me, so if you ever have a question about where I got or learned something, feel free to ask in my guestbook (and I may add it here too).

<br>
My <a href="/blog.html">blog posts</a> on webmastery include all the sources I found and used while working on technical aspects of this site and creating my ideal developer environment. 
I felt like it was most useful to attribute those in context, so please refer to individual posts for those sources.
<br><br>
There's also attribution within my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/toritried/lostletters">source code on github</a> for javascript and more. I felt like that was also better left in-line, but feel free to ask if you don't want to dig.
