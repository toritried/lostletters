On the <a target="_blank" href="https://32bit.cafe/discord/">32bit.cafe discord</a>, I asked for learning accountability buddies who would agree to write a weekly blog post about anything they've learned in the past week. If you want to join in, I'd love that! I originally planned to start with strength training for running, but my gradual, multi-week return to exercise post-covid has dampened my excitement for my original topic. All this stationary living has jumpstarted a personal fiber arts renaissance at the weirdest time of year. It just hit 29 C (84.2 F) today, which is far from my typical knitting weather; however, I've had some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/people/thebingeknitter/stash/firefly-2">linen yarn</a> in my stash since August 2016 that is begging to be made into something that I'll actually wear.

For summer, I wanted a loose and airy lace top that would act as a cover-up for my shoulders when paired with spaghetti strap tops and dresses. Even on the hottest days, I've never seen a woman in Tokyo wear a true sleeveless top that exposes their shoulders without some sort of cardigan on top, so the conformist in me insists we cover up too. Here's the garment pattern I chose to crochet to unlock the necessary modesty and heat-resistance buffs to survive summer in Tokyo: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/melissa-17">Melissa by Vicky Chan</a>

I've never crocheted a garment before, and I haven't crocheted anything since 2010, so I had a lot to learn and relearn. Although I learned how to crochet in ~2004, muscle memory of how to move a hook doesn't help decipher all the acronyms of a pattern. Here's just a taste of something similar to what I'm looking at:
<br>
<br>
` Sl st in next ch-5 space, ch 3 (_counts as dc_), 2 dc in same space, ch 2, sc in next ch-5 space, ch 2, **3 dc in next ch-5 space, ch 2, sc in next ch-5 space, ch 2** Repeat from ** to ** around. Join with a sl st to the 3rd ch at the beginning of round. `
<br>
<br>
That's from a free pattern called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lace-summer-top-2">Lace Summer Top by TLH Patterns</a>, but you get the idea. Thankfully, there are dozens of clear YouTube tutorials that show you how to make each stitch, which are nostalgically shot in 360p (at best) from 10 years ago. The comment sections are filled with gratitude and personal anecdotes from people who were taught by their grans and want to cherish their memories by learning the craft again. It's maybe the least toxic section of the internet I've found lately, and I'm worried that even sharing it here might corrupt it, but I trust you to protect this rare, cherished little corner. Anyway, all these nice people on the internet helped me make sense of crochet jargon one stitch at a time, and the progress has been incredibly rewarding.

Since I value my time, I went through the trouble of testing out my crochet gauge by making a swatch with the hook size recommended by the pattern. A swatch tells me how closely I am crocheting to the specified measurements for each pattern repeat to predictably create the desired finished size. If you just dive right into making the project without checking your gauge first, you could end up creating something much smaller or larger than expected accidentally. By creating a swatch, I learned that I needed to use a larger crochet hook than the pattern specified. Now, I can feel confident that I've set myself up for success to create a top that will fit my specific measurements.

The progress is rewarding, but slow. I'm a much faster knitter than crocheter, so I probably won't finish this before Friday, when I leave for a week-long business trip, but I'm sure I'll finish it so that I can at least wear it this summer. It sucks that Japan lags so far behind on inclusive sizing that I'm finally fed up enough to start making my own clothes. The silver lining is that it's always exciting and satisfying to become proficient at a craft and make something with my own hands.
