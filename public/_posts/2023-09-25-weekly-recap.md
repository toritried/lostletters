My intention this past week was to focus on my health and set myself up for success.<!--excerpt--> I followed through on this primarily by going to the doctor to get a letter to support taking a health-related leave of absence from work, starting in October. I also purchased and started the <a target="_blank" href="https://itsryannnicole.com/hfm">Hunger and Fullness Masterclass by Ryann Nicole</a>, a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) and Certified Nutritionist. Her podcast, The Food Freedom Lab, has helped me to realize that I still struggle to manage my emotions without food and listen to my body's hunger and fullness cues. It can get frustrating and overwhelming to feel like I haven't made progress because I'm still struggling with disordered eating, but I try to remind myself that seeking out help is already progress, and we just have to take it one day at a time.

Another problem I could no longer ignore was the fact that the insoles I got to help me recover from plantar fasciitis are so thick that none of my shoes fit with them inside. Trying to motivate myself to run and walk was hard enough without shoes that hurt and cause blisters, so I resolved to get a new, larger pair of max cushion shoes. After watching several comparison videos and trying a couple brands and models, I settled on the ASICS Gel Nimbus 25. They're heavenly--I can really feel the high squish factor when walking, but they also work for my easy runs (the only type of runs I do as I rebuild my aerobic base following the MAF method since I got covid at the end of May). I couldn't resist the amazing cooler weather this weekend, so I walked 10 km Saturday and 11 km on Sunday without getting any blisters. I'm so excited to now have comfortable shoes for my first half marathon walk with two friends at the end of October!

Speaking of friends, I'm especially grateful for my friend who helped me get a government subsidy for my mental health prescriptions last week. I was not confident that there would be anyone in my local ward office who could speak English and help me, so my friend came to translate both the documents and interactions as I submitted my application. We both learned a lot about the process, and we emerged victorious with my application approved in under an hour. This was a scary life admin task I was dreading so much, and there's no way I could have done it as quickly without such a generous and smart friend. ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹

Last week wasn't just wins though. I had my fair share of fails, but the one that keeps nagging at me is my "new" hairstyle. I went to the hair salon to get my hair bleached into an ombre look with dark brown roots that fade into blonde ends, but I left with low lights so low that my hair just looked exactly the same shade of brown overall as when I entered the salon. My hair dresser told me that the brown beige dye she put on top of the highlights she gave me would fade well, and I'd like the result in a week, but I was extremely disappointed. I really like this hairdresser as it's rare to have someone who speaks English, but she totally missed the mark this time. I've been debating for days if I should ask to schedule another appointment to get the hair I actually wanted because this doesn't come close to the reference images I sent her. I doubt I'll grow the spine for something like that, so I'll just stick with being a salty brunette for now.
