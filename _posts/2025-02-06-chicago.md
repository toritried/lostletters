It has been two months since I published my last blog post about my personal challenges with living in Japan, so I wanted to reflect on how my quality of life has improved overall in the past month of living in the US despite the recent barrage of heinous executive orders targeting communities of mine and my loved ones.<!--excerpt-->

The most significant shift in my life has been the elimination of a language barrier. I went from constantly using earbuds the moment I left my Japanese apartment to almost never wearing them unless I'm in the gym. Japan was safe and unintelligible for me, so there wasn't a point to being aware of the world around me. Now, I savor the awareness and understanding of every loud-speaker announcement in stores, phone call about a delivery order, apartment maintenance interaction, friendly Trader Joe's checkout experience, and train delay announcement. I strike up conversations with strangers in the elevator and on the train platform. Is everyone just extremely friendly in this city or have I just regained my voice and ability to channel my personality again? 

Removing the language barrier has also unlocked opportunities to build community, which is more important than ever. Getting involved at the local, community level was always part of our plan when my wife and I decided to move back. Not everyone from marginalized backgrounds has the means to flee the country just because of who was elected, so taking care of the community for us means fostering strong local support networks to ensure everyone here can weather the next four years. We finally have the chance now to leverage our resources and get to work. Volunteering for covid test distribution, sorting and stocking at a community food bank, and hosting a weekly, queer covid-cautious (masked) hangout full of crafts and healing meditation are just some of the community care actions that have been buoying my spirit lately.

The second largest shift has been the absolute joy that is ease of food access. I delight in preparing almost all my meals at home now. It's hard to resist all the amazing vegan options I have access too in grocery stores, so I'm allowing myself some financial leeway on what I add to my cart. I'm slowly unlearning the fear of traveling to a new neighborhood without having a vegan food plan in place. There are vegan options all over here, and I don't have to worry anymore. I also need to get better about not apologizing for inconveniencing others for having a restrictive diet because people here understand and support people like me. My relationship to food has always been a bit tricky, but I'm really working on noticing and welcoming in ease into that relationship this year.

One aspect that has gotten harder is being so far from my closest friends. This city has so much to offer in terms of fun events and meetups, but I do find myself wishing my old friends could just drop in at my place and hang out at a moments notice like before. We're still playing Blades in the Dark weekly online, but I have been looking for a way to stay in better touch between sessions, especially since not everyone attends consistently. I looked into starting a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.letterloop.co/">letterloop</a> with everyone, but they agreed that a lower barrier to entry would be better, so I recently added a show-and-tell channel to our discord instead. Seeing pictures from my friends that didn't make the cut for IG stories or posts--all the little, mundane moments and pictures of things that gave us a quick chuckle--makes me feel closest to them again. I'm grateful they indulge my pings to share photos.

I'll leave you with a few photos I recently shared with them:

		My wife and I built a record wall, using MOSSLANDA shelves from IKEA. It's by FAR the best furnishing decision we've made in this apartment.

		I recently took on four knitting students and taught them how to get started. We meet weekly, and this photo was from our second meeting where one student finished a blue hand towel.
