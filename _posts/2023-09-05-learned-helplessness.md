<b>CW: references to trauma without specifics</b><!--excerpt-->
<br>
<br>
For my entire life, I've had one terrible part of my life that's always followed me around. It didn't matter how great work or my relationships or my hobbies were, I was always haunted by this one bad aspect that made me live less fully. Furthermore, I had accepted that my life was always going to fall short of my hopes because I was always going to struggle with this one thing. There have been countless brief periods where I would come up with grand plans to finally "fix" the issue, but the plans would all fall apart after a couple of months (if not sooner), then I would feel foolish for falling for the idea that I could ever make a difference. If all of this sounds a bit dramatic, keep in mind that this narrative has been playing in my head daily for more than two decades and stems from growing up in a traumatic household where I had no control nor the ability to permanently escape what I knew was a bad situation until I went away to college. I've been so convinced that nothing could be done about this thing that I never even felt like it was worth bringing up in therapy. Looking back, it makes so much sense that I had never learned about "learned helplessness" until today because I was a living textbook definition of the term. Luckily, the YouTube algorithm looked at me today, said, "here, you clearly need this lol", giving me this video:

Through this video, I learned that my overwhelm causes me to dissociate into a fantasy future where the problem that haunts me doesn't exist so I can calm down. I often picture a future version of myself without that problem as well as any other challenges despite knowing that no future is perfect. I have repeatedly failed to achieve this fantasy because I've never had the tools I needed to develop a reasonable approach from my present state, but I'm much more likely to succeed after learning so much from this video and doing my own research. 
<br>
<br>
Based on the video, I came up with two actionable prompts to help me come up with more successful plans instead of just engaging with a fantasy:
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Which present challenges will I trade for new challenges of my choosing, which are necessary to become the person I want to be?</b> When I actually picture what my day-to-day life would look like as the person I want to be, it's not glamorous nor easy, so I have to carefully consider if I really want those new challenges more than my present ones. By articulating those challenges, I can compare the desirability of struggling with the new challenges I've chosen versus struggling the challenges I've resented for years. It's worth noting that should I chose to change, I will realistically end up struggling with both sets of challenges for a long-time, but the old ones will ease over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What am I going to do in the next 24-72 hours to work towards my future self?</b> This ties in really well with a personal habit I've been cultivating, which is ensuring I do one thing each day to set myself up for success tomorrow. As long as I do one thing, I've won the day. It's super simple, and the bar is so low for winning that it makes it really easy to do more than one thing each day.
  </li>
</ol>

I hope none of this was relatable to anyone else, but if it was, I hope you now have some new language to help discuss your challenges with a qualified mental health professional. Take care out there.
