Given that I only managed to keep up with one journal in 2023, jumping to three planners and journals for 2024 seems like a leap; however, I've spent a lot of time breaking down the types of tracking and reflection required to hold myself accountable for my 2024 goals, and this exercise has shaped how I plan to use each of the following techo next year. I wanted to write this as a blog post instead of a page because these systems always end up changing in an effort to adapt to my ever-evolving needs, and I wanted to capture a snapshot of my current thinking.<!--excerpt-->

<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2024/all_about/cousin/?allabout_head">Hobonichi Cousin A5</a> - Functional Accountability Journaling</h2>
So much research, intention, and iteration has gone into my plan for this book. The prompts I've included below are ones that have demonstrated lasting and profound impact on my life. They can be extremely challenging, forcing me to admit to things when I'd rather not be so vulnerable. However, I have to get a little uncomfortable and vulnerable to actually grow, so I'm cultivating these feelings daily in 2024 because I need to grow considerably to achieve all that I want in 2024. 
- **Daily Page**:
	- Checkboxes: <a target="_blank" href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_gratitude_changes_you_and_your_brain">Improve my mental health</a> by recording five things I'm grateful for
	- Morning Journaling: Set a daily intention and create an action plan to live in alignment with it by asking myself how do I want to feel today and what behaviors or actions can I add to my day to help me feel this way? (These prompts are from <a target="_blank" href="https://itsryannnicole.com/">Licensed Professional Counselor, Ryann Nicole</a>)
	- Evening Journaling: Reflect on my actions of self-love to increase my motivation to practice it by answering these questions: What did I do today to set myself up for future success today? How did I respect myself today?
	- Workout journaling: Reinforce the intrinsic motivation of feeling good from working out by writing out my workout details and how it made me feel.
	- (Sundays only): Weekly reflection to unblock myself
		- What am I avoiding?
		- What were my wins this week?
		- What is not working?
		- What am I grateful for?
		- What will I do differently next week?
- **Weekly Spread**: This is just for fun, but I plan to do coarse time tracking of work, exercise, play, reading, etc. likely using mildliner highlighters
	- Media log (books, shows, movies, etc.)
	- Hobby log (tamagotchi, knitting, web dev)
- **Monthly Spread**:
	- Workout summaries (ex: Intervals 25 min, lifting 45 min)
	- Mood tracking with a color key
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2024/all_about/original/?allabout_head">Hobonichi Original A6</a> - Decorative Memory Keeper</h2>
I hate that my memory is garbage, and I want to be appreciative and mindful of each day. Therefore, I've developed a daily practice of memory keeping where I write about at least one thing that happened each day. I love decorating these spreads with my vast collection of washi tape, stickers, pens, and inks. My style inspirations for memory keeping include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/aurore.studio/">aurore.studio

<ul>
	<li><b>Daily Page</b>: Sticker and washi tape collage with some writing to reflect on one memory per day</li>
	<li><b>Monthly Spread</b>: A word or two per day for memory keeping highlights at a glance with stickers and decorush tapes</li>
</ul>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2024/all_about/weeks/?allabout_head">Hobonichi Weeks</a> - Functional General Planner and Log</h2>
I have a pretty bad track record of consistently using a Hobonichi Weeks; however, I was massively tempted by the cover (who can resist cat-themed stationery?) as per usual and caved. If Hobonichi didn't have my wallet in a chokehold, I would consider <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HYExSfyiyqg">this very functional planner by Papertess Designs</a> that uses also uses the fountain pen-friendly Tomoe River paper. Alternatives aside, I've been using the Weeks consistently since it started on November 27, and I feel quite confident that I can keep it up because of how quick it is to fill out. My style inspiration is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ari_sumi_15/">ari_sumi_15</a>.
- **Weekly Spread**: A bullet point log of what I did each day in case I get depressed and can't be bothered to make a whole collage for my memory keeper A6
- **Weekly Notes Section**: Daily weather as well as to-do lists that draw from my 2024 goals
- **Monthly Spread**: Chore and life admin planning and logging
