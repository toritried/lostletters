A several hours after a breast reduction turned top surgery consultation, my egg cracked, revealing that I am nonbinary. I'd bet that most people who go so far as to seek out top surgery might already know they they've got some gender stuff going on, but internalized misogyny and fatphobia made it difficult for me to understand that.<!--excerpt--> I thought I just couldn't stand my chest anymore because it made daily life annoying and difficult, especially living in Japan. I was so tired of failing to live up to societal expectations put on women's bodies, and any attempts at telling myself I was a beautiful and strong woman always felt hollow anyways. 

By claiming my nonbinary identity, I have already reached a new level of peace with my corporeal form that I'd never thought was possible. I got to release my iron grip on any shred of physical acceptability. No one ever owes society anything when it comes to appearance, but I never fully internalized that message until now. I recognize though that, even with top surgery, it's not like I'll magically be able to buy clothes off the rack (Japan simply doesn't sell clothes in my size in stores), but I'll never have to be concerned about showing too much cleavage; spending more than $100 USD on high-impact sports bras that allow me run without pain; or sweating through bras in 40°C/100+°F weather ever again. What a freeing thought. 

After only ever living in a constant state of self-policing and warfare since I became aware of my body, this freedom is just about the strangest thing I can imagine. I cry for all the years I lost to that unwinnable battle, one that I didn't know I could just walk away from. But I'm safe now, and there's no time for tears. I have so much living to do.
