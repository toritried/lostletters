After more than four years of living in Japan, I finally got my first visitors! My dad and step-mom came out to see me and Japan for the first time. There was so much I wanted to show them to give a holistic sense of Tokyo, but also a slice of my life that's so different from their own, living in the US. I wanted to share the itinerary in case some stranger on the internet needs to accommodate a vegan diet while visiting Tokyo for the first time.<!--excerpt-->

<b>Day 1 | Sat, Oct 28 | 17,847 steps</b>

After a train ride from Haneda Airport in the early afternoon, Asakusa's Sensoji Temple and Kappabashi (kitchenware shopping street) area left great first impressions, and the neighborhood proved to be a good hotel location for these first-time tourists. They loved hunting for organic-looking raku pottery, getting graphic t-shirts at a larger-than-average Uniqlo store, and hitting up the 24/7 Don Quijote for souvenirs. It was cute to watch them rack up bags of KitKats and other knickknacks as they explained whose stockings would get what for Christmas. It made me just a bit sad, knowing that I have been and will continue to miss out on this tradition from their lives on other side of the world. We ended the night walking along the Sumida River after getting dinner at <a target="_blank" href="https://gonpachi.jp/asakusa/">Gonpatchi</a>, which has a dedicated vegan menu. We stumbled across a local festival complete with a donut of dancers that encircled the elevated live music performers. All of this was illuminated by electric lanterns under the light of a full moon at the foot of Tokyo's Sky Tree tower. It felt like the city was putting on its best face just for us, but that's really what Tokyo is like nearly year-round.

<b>Day 2 | Sun, Oct 29 | 20,853 steps</b>
<br>
This day, I planned to go to Wired Bon Bon in Shinjuku for mont blanc (sweet chestnut puree) parfaits, sweeping views of the city from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, as well as a tour of Shinjuku Gyoen, but a slight sprinkle of rain deterred us from the last stop. Instead, we headed to Shimokitazawa for second-hand shopping and some Thai food at <a target="_blank" href="https://titchai.tokyo/">Titchai</a> (they'll veganize their menu for you). My dad loved the food and vibes of such a small and charming dinner spot, and my step-mom appreciated that we weren't only having Japanese food on the trip because Japanese food is an undesirable leap from her usual diet of mostly salads and other American fare. Despite admonishments from the local government, we did explore Shibuya on Halloweekend because it was most convenient for their train transfer back to their hotel. I was honestly impressed at how the government managed to suppress the Halloween festivities with cops with loud speakers, harassing any groups larger than four people. The fun vibe on the street of Halloweens past was totally missing, but it was so nice to show my family around shops and malls like LoFT and PARCO without crowds.

<b>Day 3 | Mon, Oct 30 | 19,372 steps</b>
<br>
We started the day off with lunch at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/nA6h12CVnYHT3FYY8">Cosme Kitchen Adaption</a> in Shibuya (vegan items are labeled in English on their menu) to get some sorely missed leaves and vegetables into the stomach of my step-mom, then we walked through Miyashita Park, Cat Street, and Omotesando. I then took them to see my apartment and local neighborhood, finishing the night off with udon and dessert. By this point, they were sore, exhausted, and getting sick of the endless malls of Tokyo, fully understanding that shopping is an unofficial national pastime. They longed for more nature, so we decided to head to Kamakura the next day instead of checking out Yanaka Ginza (cat-themed shopping street), Nezu Shrine, and Ueno.

<b>Day 4 | Tue, Oct 31 | 13,348 steps</b>

<br>
After I checked my family into their next hotel, I navigated us by train to Kamakura to see the second largest bronze Buddha in Japan at Kotoku-in as well as their first bamboo garden at Hokokuji Temple. They were rejuvenated by more natural sights, and I was simply delighted that we actually could actually get seats on the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoshima_Electric_Railway">Eno-den (江ノ電) train</a> without the usual hoards of hot, sticky tourists, shoving their way into the most overstuffed train I've ever had the displeasure of riding. For lunch, we had decent thai food with a third story view of the beach at <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HMejfsnzezTHWJPL8">タイ料理 889</a> (they'll veganize their menu for you), then we had to book it to the bamboo grove because they close at 16:00. Despite being so much smaller than I remembered, the bamboo forest left my step-mom speechless, so I would definitely recommend this for nature lovers who have never been to a bamboo forest before. Had I recalled how small it was beforehand, we probably would have skipped it, but I'm glad we didn't. After some very careful coaching and examination of the Google Maps train directions, I let them navigate their own way back to their hotel with not much more than metro cards and a prayer. Thankfully, they made it without too much trouble, and I feel relieved that they're a bit more proficient with navigating than before, especially as they're about to be an actual paid tour guide's responsibility for the next two weeks.

This was exhausting and yet not exhaustive of all that I wanted to show them, but I'm happy we covered so much ground in the limited amount of time we had. It felt empowering being able to order food for them in Japanese and handle all things related to the metro, even if I was just taking care of the most routine things. Most days, I live acutely aware of the limit of my Japanese ability, but, during these four days, I was consistently impressed with myself, knowing that I wouldn't have been this proficient, confident, nor flexible with planning this trip on the fly without the past four years of experience. It's rare I get to see myself in such a positive light even if I had to remind them for the hundredth time that day that I can't read the kanji calligraphy on some random scroll, t-shirt, sign, or stone.
