As part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://32bit.cafe/~xandra/events/codejam5/">latest 32-bit Cafe Code Jam</a>, I wanted to teach people how to get started with knitting as I've been enjoying this creatively fulfilling and meditative hobby for over two decades, and you should too!<!--excerpt-->

I noticed that my <a href="/about-me/">About Me page</a> doesn't really document my love of knitting. Everything beyond the basic knit and purl stitches that my mother taught me as a child has been slowly self-taught through youtube and fellow knitters. While youtube is a great teacher of how to master the mechanical aspects of knitting specific stitches, I wanted to provide beginners with some initial project considerations to increase overall project satisfaction. There are definitely more advanced topics that I would love to cover (but won't be in this initial post), like how to pick different yarn colors for colorwork sweaters or how to do knitting math to adapt the pattern for a different yarn thicknesses and gauge (how many stitches fit per row and per column in a 10x10 cm square; this varies depending on the thickness of yarn, the needle size you're using, and an individual knitter's tension or how tightly they hold their yarn when knitting). Perhaps other people just intuit these things over time, but these were the types of questions I didn't even know to ask when I was starting out, so I have made a lot of unwearable or just plain ugly and awkward stuff over the years. Nowadays, I'm in more of a mastery phase where I can knit just about anything I want with yarn that reflects well-informed and complementary decisions around fiber content and colors like my most recent finished object: the Shona Top designed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/irenelin.knit/">Irene Lin</a>.

If you've never knit anything before, you're going to need an idea for a project, a measuring tape, a knitting pattern to follow, needles, and yarn at a bare minimum. If you already have inspiration, you can make an account on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/">Ravelry, a yarn and pattern database and community that is invaluable for knitters and crocheters</a>, and start browsing for a pattern that matches or is similar to your inspiration. I highly recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B7JFE9liwU">watching this video from the excellent WOOL NEEDLES HANDS podcast</a> to learn how to find what you're looking for on Ravelry. If you're ambitious, you don't need to filter the database by easy difficulty, but I would recommend doing this since you're probably not going to want to knit something like a whole garment out of the gate unless you've got a good teacher who can help you or a local, friendly yarn store where the staff can help troubleshoot any knitting problems you might cause or encounter down the line. Another reason why I wouldn't pick a sweater or something similar at this point is because your yarn tension is going to vary a lot as a beginner knitter. The more you knit, the more you'll settle into a consistent tension, creating much more even looking stitches later on. The more uniform your stitches look, the more polished the final piece will appear, especially in regards to garment. 

At this point, you're probably planning on knitting a simple scarf or a hat as your starting project, and that's great! The pattern will suggest a yarn, which has a specific weight, which is basically the yarn circumference or thickness. The most common yarn weights from thinnest to thickest are Lace, Fingering, Sport, DK, Worsted, Aran, and Bulky. Generally, the thicker your yarn, the larger the needles you need to knit. I highly recommend getting the same yarn as the pattern suggests, but if that isn't accessible to you, I would recommend going to your local yarn store nearby and asking for a recommendation for an alternative yarn that would make a good substitute. The staff should take into consideration the yarn weight as well as the fiber composition. If a pattern calls for a sport-weight linen yarn, you will want a similar linen yarn if possible because linen creates fabric with a gorgeous drape effect. If you knit it out of an animal fiber like merino wool, the final fabric will have different properties. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://donnarossa.ch/fibers-their-characteristics/">great breakdown of fibers and their resulting fabric properties to reference</a>. Generally, you'll want plant-based fibers for summer garments like cotton or linen, and animal-based fibers in winter. The exception is if you plan to machine wash all your knitting, then you'll probably want a plastic-based yarn known as acrylic. Though acrylic yarn won't breathe as well, it's inexpensive, allergy-friendly, and great if you're making an item for a baby so that the child's tired caretaker doesn't have to remember and arduously handwash your precious knitted piece. The pattern will also recommend how much yarn is needed for the specific size you're knitting, so you have to know your measurements, using your measuring tape. This is a <a target="_blank" href="https://ysolda.com/blogs/journal/choosing-a-size">great article on how to measure your upper body</a> if you're planning on knitting a garment, but save that for later since you're just knitting a hat or a scarf right now. Use your measuring tape to help visualize the various sizes listed in your pattern, figure out which one you like best, then buy however much yarn is needed for that size. If you're worried you won't have enough, you can always buy one ball or skein of yarn extra and use that for practice before you dive into the actual project. 

Now you're going to have to get needles too. Just like with yarn, there will be a recommended needle size for the pattern. The pattern might specify straight or circular needles, it may even specific multiple needle sizes. Follow the needle recommendations exactly as a starting point. Hopefully by using the needles and yarn specified in the pattern, you will knit a similar amount of stitches and rows as specified in a 10x10 cm square as specified by the pattern's gauge, but even if you don't, this your first project, so I wouldn't worry too much. Now it's time to buy these supplies and start learning the basic stitches from youtube (just search this yourself, you'll be fine) and make a swatch, aka that 10x10 cm test knit square to see if you're knitting similar to the pattern's specified gauge. If you find that you're an extremely tight knitter because you have more rows and stitches in your swatch than the pattern specifies, relax and stop strangling your yarn. Take frequent breaks, and try to breathe more evenly. If you're a loose knitter where you have too few stitches and/or rows in your swatch than the pattern specifies, try tensioning/pulling on your yarn differently so that you can achieve the desired gauge. If you knit your swatch out of anything that isn't 100% acrylic yarn, then you'll want to wet block it by getting it wet in the sink in lukewarm water and letting it fully dry flat before measuring it. Acrylic yarn doesn't change dimensions by being blocked, so you can just measure that acrylic swatch once you're finished knitting it and skip the blocking step. While the swatching and blocking aren't strictly necessary, you'll need to know how to do this before you invest a ton of time and effort into knitting something you'll eventually want to wear because it can lead to you knitting something that results in a wildly different size than what you expect. For example, if you're a loose knitter, one stitch that you knit will be larger than what the pattern specifies, meaning it will be magnified over the thousands of stitches required for a sweater for example. Your end product, if you don't take your gauge into account and knit a smaller size, will result in an end product that's bigger than your initial intent. The opposite is true for a tight knitter as the final garment will be too small. 

Now you're ready to start knitting your actual piece. I hope you fall into a meditative rhythm and find it to be creatively fulfilling! If you end up making something, I'd love to see it. If you make a mistake that you don't know how to fix, it's best to bring it to a local yarn shop or knitting meetup and ask for help. The knitting community is largely welcoming and wonderful, and now you can be a part of it!
