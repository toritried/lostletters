This is such a random post, but I wasn't happy with my life log page, so I wanted to roll up five months of 2024 life log updates into one blog post, covering milestones and notable entertainment (board games, video games, movies, books, etc). Even if you're not interested in the brief life updates, I hope you get some interesting and worthwhile entertainment recommendations from this.<!--excerpt-->

January was spent laser-focused on my goals and starting the year off on the best foot. I also started exploring clinics where I could have top surgery done and managed to book an appointment for it in March. I couldn't have done it without the help of my dear friends. They were not only there for me emotionally, but also logistically, literally serving as my medical translator. I cannot believe how lucky I am to have such compassionate, capable, and intelligent friends. I'd be utterly lost without them. 
- ran 8km for the first time since college
- held my first journaling meetup in Japan with Deru, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Emirichu">Emirichu</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/minicuteclub">Minori</a>, which was a really fun follow up to hanging out at bungu joshi
- my egg cracked after going for a top surgery consultation--I'm nonbinary!
- finished an eight-week running training plan, shaving off five minutes from my 5km; went from running 5km in 41:41 to 36:41
- ★★★★☆ Singles Inferno Season 3 (Netflix, TV Show) - everyone is super hot and entertaining, but the show is painfully hetero
- ★★★☆☆ Love is Blind Japan (Netflix, TV Show) - The show started out on a high, but then makes you dislike almost every male character by the end of the season; weird structure for a show
- ★★★☆☆ <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/">Palworld</a> (video game) - It's everything I like about Lego Fortnite, Breath of The Wild, and Pokemon
- ★★★★☆ Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea by Rita Chang-Eppig (book) - adventure story about a legendary Chinese pirate queen
- ★★★★★ Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries (book) - curmudgeonly professor goes on a trip to study faerie folklore, easy read and entertaining too
- ★★★★★ Emily Wilde's Map of the Otherlands (book) - A pleasantly entertaining fairy tale fantasy sequel featuring a lovable anti-social and introverted main character

February was split between the US and Japan because I went back to the US to get married to my lovely wife! I was surprisingly nervous in the courthouse, but we managed. As soon as that was over, my mind immediately shifted into worry mode regarding top surgery. Lots of thoughts plagued me like will I regret it? What if I die from the operation? My partner did her best to calm me down, and I appreciated her constant support. I also had some very difficult phone calls with someone I had been no-contact with for years in order to sort out paperwork needed for my citizenship application, so that was extremely stressful and awful. 
- finished my mohair cloud Ranunculus sweater (pictured)
- went back to the US to get <a href="/2024/02/16/slice-of-life-marriage">married on February 12, 2024</a>; very chill, no frills
- really enjoyed myself at the new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamlab.art/e/borderless-azabudai/">TeamLab Borderless exhibit</a>
- ★★★★★ <a target="_blank" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan">Wingspan</a> (board game) - A bird-themed boardgame with a ton of depth, still haven't figured out optimal strategies despite having played a lot  

March was a mix of highs and stressors. We celebrated my wife's birthday and her choice of a new name. Two days later, I had top surgery. I healed quickly, and managed to finish knitting two sweaters since I was not allowed to exercise for a while.

- cropped my hair super short for the first time since the pandemic
- completed my second running training plan, running a new PR: 34:46 for 5km!
- I underwent <a href="/top-surgery/">top surgery on March 15</a>, which took every ounce of bravery
- finished my Sapphic Brooklyn Raglan Lite sweater
- finished my Sidewalk Chalk Terrazzo Sweater (pictured)
- ★★☆☆☆ The Gilded Age Seasons 1 & 2 (TV Show) - an American version of Downton Abbey that didn't measure up in anyway. The costuming was whack, and the writing wasn't nearly as sharp and witty as the original. The cast stories all felt disjointed
- ★★☆☆☆ Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury / 機動戦士ガンダム 水星の魔女 (TV Show, Anime) - we had high hopes for this yuri anime, but I found the main character extremely juvenile and not endearing nor compelling
- ★★★★☆ Dune 2 (movie) - No major challenges, negative character development, but great sound design
- ★★☆☆☆ The Boy and the Heron / 君たちはどう生きるか (movie) - The film seemed to convey the simple message that you cannot dwell in grief forever, but it went about that for far too long
- ★★★★★ Polysecure by Jessica Fern (book) - really helpful to reference for how attachment styles impact polyamory, what to watch out for, etc
- ★★★★☆ <a target="_blank" href="https://vill4in.bandcamp.com/album/--10">우주해일 by 암호</a> (music) - atmospheric, cosmic/space lofi chiptune track to disassociate to, which I discovered in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utopiadistrict.com/articles/2023-vaporwave-selections/">this great vaporwave roundup</a>

April was when the work burnout started really hitting, but I tried to push through anyways. The sakura at the start of the month really helped lift my spirits, but, as they faded, I had to face reality: I was really not okay. I used board games as an escape, and they became my whole personality. Golden Week, a period in the Japanese calendar where there are a lot of holidays in a row, was spent traveling near Osaka with friends, and getting away from work really helped clarify that I needed to go back out on leave. 
- ★★★★★ <a target="_blank" href="https://hinokodo.itch.io/miru-an-analog-adventure-game">MIRU I</a> (solo RPG) - such a fun and easy-to-learn solo hex adventure rpg. I don't want to spoil any of the story, but it's worth buying if you're hungry to be spoon-fed an adventure and there's no DM around to help you. During my burnout, I didn't have any energy to be creative, so this was perfect.
- ★★★★★ <a target="_blank" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/240980/blood-on-the-clocktower">Blood on the Clocktower</a> (social game) - This social deduction game changed my brain and life. I've made friends because of it; I've lost sleep thinking about it; I've spent hours listening to strategy podcasts just to create my own player strategy spreadsheet for it. To say that I'm obsessed is an understatement. It's like mafia or werewolf, but much improved. I actually hated werewolf / social deduction games before I played this, and only gave it a chance because it's expensive and a lot of people like it. I'm so glad I gave social deduction games one last chance!
- ★★★★★ <a target="_blank" href="https://poesiebungu.com/products/sailor-%E3%82%BB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC-%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4%E7%AD%86-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A6%E3%83%AD%E3%83%A9">Poesie Bungu Original Limited Edition Aurora Sailor Pro Gear</a> (fountain pen) - If you're going to come with a 21k gold nib and cost ¥55,000 JPY ($350 USD), you better be perfect. Of course, it slipped out of my hand in May, bending the nib at a sickening angle, but I immediately contacted my friend <a target="_blank" href="https://tokyostationpens.com/">CY of Tokyo Station Pens</a>, and he returned it to working order in less than ten minutes. 

By May, my mental health was at its limit. I talked to my doctor, and we decided it was best to go back out on medical leave. Outside of work, I spent as many moments as possible going to board game meetups around the city, so my brain could deeply focus on something other than work stress. I also got my daily exercise by hunting down vintage tamagotchi from nearly every secondhand shop in an hour and a half train radius from Tokyo. Tamagotchi took over my entire brain because I got overly hyped about the news that Bandai will re-release the V3 Connection model. I spent so much money on Tamagotchi in the second half of the month.

- ★★★★★ <a target="_blank" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/368017/point-city">Point City</a> (board game) - A lot like Splendor (chip-collecting and card development), but better! I immediately purchased a copy of it after playing it. 
- ★★★★☆ <a target="_blank" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/225482/seas-of-strife">Seas of Strife</a> (board game) - a fun and easy-to-learn trick-taking game where you actually want to avoid taking tricks, which count as points against you. Immediately bought a copy on sale after playing it. 
- ★★★★★ <a target="_blank" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/338960/slay-the-spire-the-board-game">Slay the Spire</a> (board game) - got the opportunity to play this at a friend's house with a bunch of Spire fans. I was given the most straightforward character, and I had a ton of fun dealing out big damage thanks to drawing some OP rare cards that created an excellent combo. 
- ★★★★☆ <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/">Slay the Spire</a> (video game) - obviously I'm very late to this, but I had fun playing it nonetheless after being introduced to the franchise by the boardgame. I wish the video game had a way to calculate exact damage possibilities because with large numbers, you really just need to intuitively know whether you're going to be able to defeat something or not.  
- ★★★★★ <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/">Balatro</a> (video game) - so I was a little late to this recent indie darling video game, but I was quickly hooked. I kept thinking I'll just try to beat the game one more time, and 4 hours later I'm dehydrated and bleary-eyed, wondering what happened to my day. I don't even like poker, so I was really surprised that I ended up liking this wild riff on that game. When I started, I swear I didn't even know what a straight versus a flush was, and now I'm extremely well-versed. 
- ★★★☆☆ <a target="_blank" href="https://byodinsbeardrpg.itch.io/runecairn-wardensaga">Runecairn Wardensaga</a> (solo RPG) - Maybe it's just me, but the random dice tables didn't feel big enough, so encounters got repetitive quickly. I also didn't like the lack of looting after fighting because I had really enjoyed that from MIRU. 

June has only just started, so I haven't gotten up to much yet. The only thing I've watched was Saltburn (movie), which I'd rate ★★★★☆. I was gripped by the extreme and unsettling explorations of obsession and desire in this film. Barry Keoghan delivered a phenomenal performance as the star. I hope to enjoy many more things this month now that I'm on leave from work, so I think my end of June wrap up will be a juicy one.
