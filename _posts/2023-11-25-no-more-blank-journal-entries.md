I want to share my strategy for filling in missing journal entries as someone who recently just filled in 9 weeks worth of missing entries in my daily memory keeper journal.<!--excerpt--> This journal allows me to transport myself into any given day in the past and relive a good memory or experience for which I am grateful. When I struggle with depression or even just boring days, it can be hard to motivate myself to keep up with this journal. That’s why I developed a _Blank Page Protocol_, which is a strategy to help me fill in missing journal entries even when a lot of time has passed or I’ve had a long spell of skipped entries. Feel free to take any of these ideas or build on this list as your own mileage may vary.

On the days I feel like skipping (the day may be too boring; it feels overwhelming to take out my journal; etc.), here are a few low-effort things I do to help my future self backdate an entry:

- Snap a photo of anything notable or that I appreciated - these can be vivid reminders for my future self or can serve as inspiration for a illustration later on. I try to photograph the entrances or signage of places I’ve been to help contextualize photos of random things like food.
- Digital Notes - Instead of reaching for a pen a paper, it's often easier for me to just open the notes app on my phone when I've been rotting on the couch for hours. I make sure to write how I'm feeling, what the weather's like, and what is notable (and why!) to paint a more immersive picture of how I feel about something. Putting things in relative terms also helps contextualize why something is notable (ex: we’re in a heatwave or service was much worse than last time).
- Location History - I have location history turned on with Google Maps, so I can use the <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6258979">timeline feature</a> to see where I traveled on a given day.
- Digital Calendar - I make sure it’s up to date, and add in time blocks to indicate what I was doing, making, watching (specificity is key; the season of a show is better than just the title), etc.

When I’m feeling ready to backdate entries, here are all the digital nooks and crannies I’ve looked at to help me remember what I was doing on a given day that are more passive and automatic:

- Email - I filter my inbox by date ranges, so I can see what I was up to if I forget. It’s especially helpful to recall online purchases.
- Social Media - I use <a target="_blank" href="https://cutie.city/@lostletters">Mastodon</a> like a Now Page to reflect what I’m getting up to. I posted daily Mastodon toots to to capture my travels in a trip log thread while I was traveling for a month in Europe this past summer and didn’t have access to my journal, and it was essential to helping me fill in missed entries. I recommend creating a thread or using a hashtag to help organize posts for later.
- Fitness Tracker - I love and use my Garmin watch daily. It records my route, and I also sometimes record additional notes about the types of exercise I did, perceived effort, etc.
- Blog - My weekly recap posts can be super helpful, especially if I included specific dates, but blog entries take a lot of effort to write in the first place, so they don’t always get written nor published when I don’t have the energy to give to my journal.
- Reading logs - I use the <a target="_blank" href="https://libbyapp.com/">Libby app</a> to borrow audiobooks and ebooks from the library, so I can go back into my borrow history to get an idea of what I was reading or listening to at a given time. I also use <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/lostletters">The StoryGraph</a>, so I can see the dates of when I started and finished reading books.

I want to keep adding to this list as my mental health may render some of these methods inaccessible to me in the future, so please get in touch if you have any other ideas for how to leave low effort clues for my future self to piece together.
