I'm nearly 30 and, although I can whip up cooked meals with ease and confidence, I have nearly zero intuition when it comes to making a satisfying leafy salad. As a vegan, I've been subjected to many a sad, cold salad as the only vegan option at a restaurant, which has led me to kind of resent them, honestly. However, when I eat a lot of veggies, my skin is clearer, and I don't get acid reflux before sleeping, so I'm going to try to take care of myself by learning ‚Äúsalad theory‚Äù.   
<!--excerpt-->
  \
By the end of this, I want to be able to:
1. Understand how to create satisfying salads *(tackling this today)*
2. Be able to discern why a specific salad works or doesn't + identify what I could add to make it more satisfying
3. Develop enough ‚Äúsalad intuition‚Äù to confidently throw together salads from the dregs of my fridge as easily as I'm able to cook
4. Develop a core corpus of go-to salad recipes I actually crave and enjoy eating

## Salad Formula
Starting off with a YouTube search, I found Nisha of Rainbow Plant Life's video: [My Formula for Fantastic Salads | healthy + vegan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgITcbIrysc), which also comes in a [free PDF version](http://bit.ly/2KPr4D5) if you prefer to read or have a printout.  I've summarize some of it in this blog post with many additions and suggestions from friends. 
  
  \
ü•¨ **Make a salad base** 
Leafy greens like lettuce and kale are obvious (and should be seasoned directly with salt & pepper), but Nisha suggests making these more interesting by
1. adding grains like farro, rice (brown or wild), barley
2. adding lentils or beans
3. omitting leafy veg entirely in favor of lentils, grains, fresh herbs, or blanched/marinated veg (ex: asparagus, green beans)
4. mixing greens for contrast (soft greens like spinach with crunchier greens like napa cabbage)  
  
  \
ü•í **Top with Textures**
Consider the following textures for inspiration and interest:
1. **Crunchy** - toasted nuts or seeds (or a blend like this [spiced super seed salad topper](https://abraskitchen.com/spiced-super-seed-salad-topper/)), croutons, carrots, everything but the bagel seasoning
2. **Crispy** - raw veg like cucumbers, snap peas, apple, red onion slices
3. **Creamy** - avocado, dressing, roasted kabocha
4. **Chewy** - dried fruits, roasted chickpeas, rice, farro, barley, roasted root veg, potato
5. **Misc** - roasted corn, olives, grapes, fresh berries, pickled veg, [marinated extra firm tofu](https://plantbasedrdblog.com/2022/09/4-tasty-tofu-marinades-how-to-use-them/), leftover instant noodle flavor packet
  
  \
üíß **Pair dressings with greens**
-  For **tough, hearty greens** like raw kale or shaved brussel sprouts, Nisha recommends a **creamy dressing** with lemon.
-  For **tender or peppery greens** like spinach or arugula, make a **vinaigrette**.

## Four-Part Salad Dressing Formula 
The most helpful guide I found was from Denise of [AdultFoodAllergies.com](http://adultfoodallergies.com/salad-dressing-recipe-theory/):
1. ü•ë **Base** - EVOO, sesame oil, chopped tomatoes, yogurt, mayo, silken tofu, avocado, cashew cream
2. üçã **Acid** - vinegar (red wine, rice wine, balsamic, apple cider), citrus (lemon, lime, orange), pickle juice
3. üçÅ **Emulsifier** - mustards, maple syrup, jam or fruit preserve, tahini, tomato paste
4. üå∂ **Spice/Flavor** - pepper, salt, sugar (dates), chili powders, grated or powdered garlic or ginger, fresh herbs (dill, parsley, cilantro, mint, scallions), dried herbs (marjoram, thyme, rosemary, oregano, basil), hot sauces, soy sauces  
  
  \
‚öñ **The Golden Ratio (Base:Acid)**
-  Conventional wisdom suggest a 3:1 ratio of Base to Acid
-  Denise plays with a 1:2 ratio because she prefers her dressing "screaming" (acidic)
Aside from this ratio, it seems like the exact measurements of dressing stuff is all to-taste, which works for me.   
  
  \
ü§î To return to dressing pairings, a creamy dressing might look like avocado + lemon, red wine vinegar + dijon mustard + black pepper, salt, grated garlic, fresh parsley. A vinaigrette for fresh spinach could be: EVOO, red wine vinegar, mustard, grated garlic, sugar, S&P, red pepper, and dried herbs. Without actually going into the kitchen to test, I can't be sure those are decent dressings, but I feel like I'm getting the hang of this? I'll test one of them tomorrow if I'm feeling better (currently fighting off a sinus infection) and can get to the grocery store. I am tempted to get a microplane, but there are plenty of salads I can make without one to start. If I end up wanting one later, [Serious Eats's recommended this one](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-microplane-graters-5341382).

üî• **A brief note on hot salads / cooked veg**: they are entirely valid, but I'm more comfortable cooking, so I wanted to focus on the raw, cold side of salads first. In researching this topic though, I did get a strong recommendation for this [Warm Kale and Chickpea Salad by Bondi Harvest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgf18HQ738k). I'd also love to become more proficient at Chinese stir-fried veg because it's so easy to add in some cheap tofu for a filling meal. Lucas Sin created a great [technique video](https://youtu.be/h8EcbCXv6M0) , which I will follow and veganize where needed. Here's a brief summary for completeness: 
- Leafy greens - processed and cleaned
- Seasoning - salt, sugar, MSG
- Aromatics - garlic OR ginger
	- not both usually to help showcase the greens
	- smash garlic if you don't want people to eat it, but just have the flavor
- Ripping hot pan - shimmering oil
