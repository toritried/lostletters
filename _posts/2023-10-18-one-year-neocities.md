I remember when I just created my Neocities account on October 28 last year. I was brimming with inspiration from sites across the yesterweb (it still existed at that time). At first, all I wanted to do was create a pink site with a pixel toybox and enjoy the thrill of having bite-sized cuteness on my page. However, when it came to actually creating literally anything else of substance, I'll never forget my girlfriend encouraging me to create something that only <i>I</i> could. That's been the guiding principle behind Lost Letters ever since.<!--excerpt-->

<br>
As a non-technical amateur who was returning to web development for the first time in over a decade, there was so much to learn. I tried to use my beginner lens to helpfully document the <a href="https://lostletters.neocities.org/2022/11/02/jekyll">process of creating a site using Jekyll and GitHub for fellow beginners</a>. Several other <a href="https://lostletters.neocities.org/tag/webmastery/">webmastery blog posts</a> were similarly inspired. If I'm trying to figure something out, I write the documentation I wish I had while going through the process. I encourage others to do the same, especially if you're completely new to it.
<br>
<br>
Another major undertaking that was something only I could create and share was <a href="https://lostletters.neocities.org/quilt/">my own personal experience and connection to the quilting bee</a>. It's not even on my top 5 most visited pages, but I poured my soul into creating that shrine, spending hours on the internet archive; diving back into cherished bookmarks that I could never quite get myself to delete; and reconnecting with the former queen and staff bees to get as many files as I could. It was the first page I was truly proud of on this site.
<br>
<br>
While nostalgia is well and good, I didn't want to stop there. I wanted to revive some of the magic of the old web, so my next project was launching the <a href="https://lostletters.neocities.org/afternoontea/">Afternoon Tea Pixel Club</a>. I've been so absolutely blown away by its reception across the small web. Technically, it launched on November 7, 2022, so I'll probably throw a mini tea party celebration once we actually hit one year, but I can't believe I've received 62 submissions as of the day I'm writing this. Every single time someone sends in a cup they made, it makes my day. Please don't stop.
<br>
<br>
Having social aspects to web development has been the biggest reason why I was able to stick with this hobby for a whole year. I love being able to follow inspiring sites across neocities, connect with and help plan events for fellow web devs through the amazing <a target="_blank_" href="https://32bit.cafe/">32-bit.cafe community</a> (especially after the implosion of the yesterweb), and keep up with blog posts within and beyond neocities for free with RSS. Every day, my world is expanded and enriched by the many folks crafting the small web, sharing their knowledge, interests, and hobbies. Through this little web dev endeavor of mine and the community that surrounds it, I've constantly been taught that I don't know what I'm capable of until I try. Things are almost always completely opaque at the start, but so much is possible when I approach things and just say, "let's just try and figure this out," instead of shutting the door on myself and closing off any potential for me to grow. I'm so grateful that I had and continue to have the courage to try, and I hope you do too as a fellow person on the small web.
