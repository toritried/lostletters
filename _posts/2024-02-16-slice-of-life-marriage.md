**CW: food mention, fear of death**
<br>
<br>
Since it has been a while since my last post, I just wanted to share a little slice of life update. <!--excerpt-->

On Monday, February 12, my partner and I got married. I high fived her in the courthouse after saying "I do." because I was so relieved and amped that I simply forgot people usually kiss then. We had our masks on because we're still trying to avoid covid, so perhaps it was for the best. Regardless, it just felt right in the moment, and, briefly, it was like I was watching us in a movie as the frame froze on that high five and the credits rolled. We decided to forgo writing our own vows as well as giving rings, so it was just a simple affair with a judge and  three witnesses--all friends, no family. We met up with both of our families at lunch beforehand at an empty Thai place in a Seattle suburb that could accommodate 10 for lunch. The damp of the day slowly evaporated off us as we ate decently spicy Thai food under long tubes of fluorescent lights. We half-heartedly promised our families that we'd have a big official celebration one day to reassure them that they weren't missing out by not being invited to the courthouse, but I doubt they'll hold us to that.

As soon as we checked off getting married from our to-do list, my mind shifted back to my looming top surgery appointment in March. I'm honestly still scared as this is a "high risk surgery" for my specific situation. There are a couple of common fears my brain jumps to like what if I get a blood clot and die or what if I don't like the result, but I try to just remind myself that I'm strong and resilient, which I've proven to myself over and over again through running. Right before my wedding trip, I actually finished my 8-week training plan and ran 5km 5 minutes faster than when I started. The surgery is an intense source of motivation to keep this up so that I can get as healthy as possible beforehand. I'll likely stay quiet here as I focus on my health through mid-March, but I hope I'll have some great news to share afterwards.
