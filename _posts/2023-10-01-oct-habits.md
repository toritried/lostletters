September was filled with significant strides in health improvement, but, after nearly 8 years of working, I've finally committed to taking my first health-related leave of absence from work. This past month, I've made huge strides in recognizing and addressing my disordered eating; I've worked with my doctor to further adjust my bipolar medication; and I've secured the strongest support systems I've ever had to continue my health management journey. It has been frustrating to see my hobbies like web development, knitting, journaling, and running take a backseat this month, but I really had to focus on my health. Now that I won't be working for a while, I hope that I can feel safe and inspired to engage with some hobbies once more.

Looking ahead to October, I'm a little nervous by having just so much free time. As a person with ADHD, I need structure to my days. I hate not having a plan because it means that my indecision will paralyze me in bed until I feel like I've wasted the day. To avoid that, I have several new habits I'd like to integrate into my daily routine to get me out of bed and build some momentum. 

For the past 7 days, I've completed my morning pages, a practice from The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron (I don't recommend the book, but the practice is good). Technically, my "morning pages" are more like a single A6 page, but I'm proud of my consistency regardless. Getting out of bed to brain dump when my head is relatively empty is frictionless. It ensures I get out of bed shortly after waking up, and it makes me use stationery that would otherwise go to waste, so I want to keep up this rewarding habit through the month of October at least. 

In terms of new habits, I want to actually finish one of those monthly fitness calendars published by the likes of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIJwWYOfsCfz6PjxbONYXSg">Blogilates</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@yogawithadriene">Yoga with Adriene</a>. I chose Adriene's <a target="_blank" href="https://yogawithadriene.com/calendar/">October yoga calendar</a> because I still plan on running, lifting, or using my TRX daily for workouts and alternating with walking on recovery days to improve my emotional regulation. I need to dedicate myself to stretching not only to improve my plantar fasciitis, but also to prevent any injury from the increased movement. I foresee this being difficult at the end of the month when my dad and stepmom visit for three days, but even if I'm not perfect, getting in any yoga at all will be a huge achievement. 

The last daily habit that I hope to follow through with is using headspace to meditate. I've got a free subscription through work, and I could always use more tools to help with anxiety management, especially since finding a decent therapist in Japan is a joke. Even if I only sit down for 5 minutes to mediate like today, I'll be happy with that.
