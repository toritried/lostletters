After ~70 hours, I've finished knitting the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/projects/foolishfibers/faye-summer-top">Faye Summer Top by Irene Lin</a>, using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sandnes-garn.com/line#long_description">Sandnes Garn Line yarn</a>, which is made of 53% cotton, 33% viscose, and 14% linen. Since this yarn is made of plant-based fibers, it doesn't give at all, so it was rather unforgiving to knit with. My hands were so sore at the end of each day.<!--excerpt--> This is what I was going for:

My version is knitted with a slightly thicker yarn than what the pattern was originally knit with. Using a thicker yarn allowed me to knit two sizes smaller than I originally intended, which is something I learned after doing a bit of knitting math to compare the fabric of my gauge swatch and the one specified in the pattern. That meant fewer stitches for me to knit and a faster knitting experience overall. Still, it was an absolute slog. Making bobbles with unyielding plant fibers sucked. However, I am so pleased with how it turned out. <a href="https://cutie.city/@lostletters/110610974087677793" target="_blank">I posted daily progress updates for 10 days to a thread on my mastodon account</a>, but here are the final shots of it on me. Even despite how loud my body dysmorphia is, I still like it enough to post these photos, which says a lot.

I followed the pattern exactly, but was quite annoyed at how the yarn over holes on one side were larger than the other. I still haven't blocked the garment, which might fix the issue. A kind knitter on mastodon referred me to this amazing resource: <a target="_blank" href="https://pattylyons.com/product/patty-lyons-knitting-bag-of-tricks/">Patty Lyons' Knitting Bag of Tricks</a>, even going so far as to send me a photo of the yarn over page to help me troubleshoot the issue. I'll definitely be picking up a copy of this book in the future, as it is just filled with helpful tips for knitting.

During the process of knitting this top, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZRzRL4V66w0?t=1667">Hundred Acre Wool</a> turned me onto <a target="_blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1124509243/knit-keeper-cord-xl-project-set?ref=yr_purchases">silicone cords</a> that needles can be inserted into in order to transfer stitches onto them. Upon closer inspection, these are just cut versions of rubber tubing for wires, so I just searched for that and purchased the rubber tubing myself. They're all coming from the same manufacturer in China anyways. This enabled me to try my garment on as I was knitting it with the added bonus of being able to take really nice progress shots. I wish the stitches glided across the tubing a little more smoothly, but it's absolutely worth getting regardless.

I'm now embarking on my second summer knit: the <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/umbria-summer-top" target="_blank">Umbria Summer Top by Cookie the Knitter</a>, but I've already decided to do some modifications, which you can find in detail on my <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/projects/foolishfibers/umbria-summer-top" target="_blank">Ravelry project page</a>. I will not be knitting the button band. With a large bust, I know I'll just feel more comfortable with a pull-over top, so I don't have to always worry that it will unbutton on me. I still love the look of the placket (the part of the garment that looks like a button band) folding open to give mock lapels, so I've done that part of the neckline. However, I've seamed the two placket pieces together to create a polo look.

I'm so excited about my finished piece and the next one on my needles, but there is always a cost I pay for enjoying my hyperfocus. I've been woefully neglecting my other hobbies and needs like updating this website and running too. I really wish I were more consistent, but I'm trying my best, figuring out how to live a happy, full, and somewhat balanced life with my ADHD brain.
