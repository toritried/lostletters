To minimize saddle soreness during a two-day bike trip in two weeks, I started practicing long rides on an indoor bike today. It feels strange to prepare so responsibly, but I'm really proud of how I'm trying my best to live in alignment with my theme for this year: self-respect.

<br>
I got the idea of setting a yearly theme from CGP Grey's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">Your Theme video</a>. In a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lEFP_taZxo0?t=89">Cortext podcast episode</a>, Grey and his co-host describe it as an **overall idea of how you want to approach each year**, which becomes a guide for you in your life. For example, instead of setting a binary goal like "run a marathon" (which only has two states: success or failure), define the year as a Year of Running such that any decisions you make in service of your broad theme count as progress.
<br>
<br>
For 2023, I chose self-respect mostly because I needed a much more reasonable expectation than self-love. I'm just not there yet, but I know that I don't have to love or even like someone to extend respect and empathy to them, which is thanks to my training in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/what-is-nvc">non-violent communication (NVC)</a>.  NVC emphasizes deep listening to ourselves and others in order to understand and communicate each other's needs with compassion instead of blame, judgement, or domination. I hope to cultivate this with myself, so I've aimed to inwardly extend respect and empathy through small and large decisions this year. 
<br>
<br>
Aside from my nearly 1.5-hour bike ride today, other recent decisions that align with my theme include:
<ul>
    <li>Thanking my body for the opportunity to run whenever I finish a run instead of bemoaning my pace or endurance</li>
    <li>Internally validating my struggles and unmet needs by seeking out professional help instead of gaslighting myself</li>
    <li>Choosing the most nourishing food option instead of the most convenient one</li>
</ul>
<br>
I'm not perfect, and there certainly are times when I'm in a downward spiral for a few days. However, the compound effect of living in alignment with my theme *most* of the time has been really eye-opening. I can hardly believe how much I've been able to achieve since I stopped working against myself, and I can't wait to see where I end up by the end of this year.
