This was originally posted to my Now page, but I'm moving all of those updated to the blog. Here's what I got up to this week:<!--excerpt-->

<ul>
    <li><b>Processing:</b> Today is my 7th work anniversary. While I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities I'd had during this time, so much has changed including me.</li>
    <li><b>Listening to:</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Itos0zfA3s&ab_channel=Coldhands">Coldhands - Oncle House</a></li>
    <li><b>Reading:</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://publishing.tor.com/themimickingofknownsuccesses-malkaolder/9781250860514/">The Mimicking of Known Successes by Malka Older</a> - a short, sci-fi murder mystery and sapphic romance novella. Loving the efficient pace and rich world building. This will be the 15th book I've finished this year. My 2023 DNF pile is huge, so I'm glad I like this enough to finish it.</li>
    <li><b>Celebrating:</b> finishing my <a href="/pride">Pride</a> page a week early for the <a target="_blank" href="https://32bit.cafe/pride23/">32-bit cafe</a> submission deadline! I was feeling so uninspired by my original idea (a virtual tag along to Tokyo Rainbow Pride), so I was just thinking broadly about all my queer adjacent memories and thought I should make that act of thinking and exploring my queer identity the focus of the page. Even though it's simple, I am really happy with how it turned out.</li>
    <li><b>Hoping for:</b> a return to running after being waylaid by plantar fasciitis. This has impacted me for months, but after not running for a week, I'm actually starting to feel pain-free. I want to give it a few more days before I try anything just to be safe. Podiatry isn't recognized in Japan, so I have to pay out of pocket for a sport medicine specialist in July. I'm really hoping I'm completely fixed by then, but I'd still like to get custom insoles to prevent this from ever happening again.</li>
</ul>
