Building this website has been both extremely empowering and humbling at the same time. I have a kanban board of ideas for what I want to tackle next (mostly behind the scenes stuff), but I'm often at the edge (okay, very far beyond) the limit of my current technical literacy. As a person who has a loose grip on HTML and CSS, so many of these web development tools feel inaccessible (I'm looking at you, Jekyll). Without ever taking a single programming class, I often find myself unable to describe what it is that I want to create for my website in a way that triggers the right keywords of my web search for documentation, and it can get frustrating. Yet, I persist (with a lot of generous help from Bean, a professional web developer, and kind strangers who document webmastery on the neocities like [Sadness](https://learn.sadgrl.online/)).


My latest persistence-filled project was figuring out how to get a blog onto this neocities site. Initially, I simply followed Sadness' guide to **[the easiest way to make a 'blog' on Neocities](https://learn.sadgrl.online/the-easiest-way-to-make-a-blog-on-neocities/#how-this-works)**, which leverages a Dreamwidth account. If you can copy+paste, you can complete the guide, and you'll get a text editor on [Dreamwidth.org](http://dreamwidth.org) that looks more like what you're probably used to for text editors with buttons to click for text styling (instead of having to learn/use markdown). Unfortunately, the UI looked dated in a way that didn't make me want to blog and lacked dark mode. Most importantly, the RSS feed could only show posts within the last 14 days, which was the main kicker for me given that I didn't expect to be blogging that much. 


After speaking with Bean, she suggested that I might be interested in a **[Static Site Generator](https://kinsta.com/blog/static-site-generator/)**, which would enable so much more than just a blog, but would require a non-trivial amount of effort on my part to understand because I'd need to send commands in Terminal, download Visual Studio Code for code editing, and more that I'd never done before.


Until this point, I had been chaffed being unable to sufficiently **templatize** my site without Neocities supporting PHP. Essentially, I was looking to setup my site such that I would only have to see the content I wanted to edit with everything else inherited. I also wanted **instant previewing** of my code changes, and better UX for code editing.


Having given up on [dreamwidth.org](http://dreamwidth.org/), I decided to give Jekyll/GitHub/VS Code a shot. I blame [Techno Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q&ab_channel=TechnoTim) for making it look easy. _Spoiler_: it wasn't, because I had no prior experience using these programs and I had already built my site, so I needed to adjust my code to play nicely with Jekyll.


As I went through the process of getting this static site generator up and running, I documented all the steps I took in the hopes that someone else with **zero technical background** can see what this entails end-to-end and see if it's something they want to try.
