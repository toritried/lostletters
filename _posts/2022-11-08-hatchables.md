I have never stopped loving the magic of adopting a virtual pixel egg and waiting for it to hatch into something glorious. They're like a much more visually detailed tamagochi without the accidental neglect and disappointingly unpredictable lifespan. I've recently signed up to adopt these hatchable pixels at several sites and created my own [hatchery page](/hatch/). I wanted to share the list of virtual pet sites I came across with brief reviews in case you want to sign up too!
<!--excerpt-->
1. [https://magistream.com/](https://magistream.com/) - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Eggs will hatch into stunning fantastic beasts and animals. The art is superb. There are no click caps, and pets evolve quickly. The site has been around for 10+ years and has a strong group maintaining it.  
2. [https://flowergame.net/flowers/wildgarden](https://flowergame.net/flowers/wildgarden) - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê If you're more into gardening than pets, this is a great choice. Views and clicks help your plants grow, and there are cute mini-games to replenish your growing resources.   
3. [https://finaloutpost.net/](https://finaloutpost.net/) - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê This is the most chill option because these pets evolve regardless of clicks (they're just time-based). Clicks help the pets grow faster and improve stats.   
4. [https://dragcave.net/](https://dragcave.net/?r=1) - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Very similar to magistream with great art, but it has click rate caps that will make pets sick if exceeded. üòü  

If you have recommendations for any other virtual pet sites like these or would like me to click your pets, [drop a link in my guestbook](http://users.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&i=g19-00587-ce) or [toot at me on Mastodon](https://social.yesterweb.org/@lostletters)!
