It's one of those weeks where nothing is satisfying, so I bounce between websites and devices until I finally find myself mindlessly scrolling the absolute bottom of the barrel for "something". I think I'm seeking out a new fixation to feel good again or a way to dissociate from the blah. I probably just need to sleep, and I wonder if this isn't just me slowly slipping into a depressive phase. Come to think of it, I probably started a hypomanic phase in the beginning of June, so we're actually right on track to come down after 3 months. I have a meeting with my psychiatrist tomorrow, so this is perfect timing to ensure I get the help I need through the next couple months as I ride the depressive phase.

Nothing quite helps put things into the perspective of linear time quite like writing things out. I really should journal more. I actually want to start posting blog entries more frequently into the void, shamelessly sharing the mundane like how I had *zaru udon* for dinner because it's nice to be able to feel capable of eating in a traditional Japanese restaurant instead of going to my same vegan old haunts. If you are vegan and also seeking out these refreshing cold udon noodles on a summer day in Japan, be sure to skip the dipping sauce called *mentsuyu*. It most certainly has *dashi* (fish flakes) in it. Just use soy sauce or BYO if you're really in the know.

Of course, there is something nice about becoming a regular. The other day, I went to my favorite local Indian restaurant. The credit card machine was out of order, and I didn't have cash, so the owner said don't worry about it. I can just pay next time. I immediately went to the *conbini* that was just a three-minute walk away and withdrew cash to run back to them, but it was still a heartwarming gesture to float the bill. They also remarked that I'd been away for about 20 days, which was wild because I hadn't told them about my trip to Europe. I actually felt a little guilty that I hadn't, and that I also hadn't brought them back *omiyage* in the form of souvenir chocolate or something. "Next time", I said to myself. I always hope I'll be better next time.
