I'm not sure if the concept of a "Play Plan" exists, but I'm taking inspiration from one of my other hobbies (knitting) and the trend of creating a "Make Nine", which is typically a gridded photo on IG of nine projects you want to complete before the end of the year. This is my TTRPG version of a *Make Nine*, but instead of projects I want to knit, it's an arbitrary number of games I want to play, hence the name *TTRPG Play Plan*.<!--excerpt-->

I felt inspired to do this after I catalogued the interesting majority of my digital TTRPG collection, which includes 34 core rulebooks, 2 hacks, 11 modules, and 10 resources *for now*. The vast majority of those games came from itch.io charity bundles, but it's still ridiculous to own so many considering I don't even run games for other people. After recording which ones I've played, I found out that I've played less than 30% of the games I own, so I have to do something about that. I wanted to focus on just games I could possibly play solo that I've never tried before, which leaves me with the following list:
1. <a target="_blank" href="https://disastertourism.itch.io/evergreen-wilds">Evergreen Wilds</a> is a solo roleplaying game that allows a player to live and explore a season as a park ranger in a national park. I'm not going to lie, this sounds kind of dull (why imagine nature when I could just go out and be in it?), but it could help me work on my writing and creative thinking skills since I often struggle to keep solo journaling games interesting for myself, so I'll try it.  
2. <a target="_blank" href="https://mkirin.itch.io/iron-valley">Iron Valley</a> is a cozy solo TTRPG hack for Ironsworn and Starforged that is inspired by Animal Crossing, Story of Seasons (Harvest Moon), and Stardew Valley. I'm honestly not a fan of real Stardew Valley--I feel like it requires me to do a lot of homework or research to know what to do when or how to optimize play, which is weird for a "cozy game" imo--but I'm willing to give this a shot.
3. <a target="_blank" href="https://shawn-tomkin.itch.io/sundered-isles-expansion-for-ironsworn-starforged">Ironsworn: Sundered Isles</a> is a solo TTRPG where you play as a rebellious seafarer undertaking sworn quests in a world that is equal parts Age of Sail and fantasy, with hints of emerging steampunk technologies and eldritch curses. Thankfully, this one seems action packed, and I'm very familiar with and enjoy the Ironsworn system, so hopefully this will be easy to get into.
4. <a target="_blank" href="https://marrensmusings.itch.io/lordsworn">LORDSWORN</a> is a GMless TTRPG where you will be a fragile, shattered creature clinging to others for survival in the face of a dying world, inspired by Elden Ring amongst other things. Seems bleak, but I like it when I have to make tough choices in a game and the stakes feel high because survival is not guaranteed (probably why I lean to hard into OSR games).
5. <a target="_blank" href="https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/wanderhome">Wanderhome</a> is a pastoral fantasy game for which I found some <a target="_blank" href="https://mephitjamesblog.wordpress.com/2021/09/21/solo-worksheets-for-wanderhome/">worksheets</a> that will hopefully help me get more out of the experience. I'm not always in the mood for gentle, story-rich tales, but I'm curious to see how the typical token-based emergent roleplay works in solo mode (if it's not scrapped altogether). I have only ever played a similar game (Yazeba’s Bed & Breakfast, Jay Dragon's other token-based game) as part of a group of folks who were excellent at improv. 
6. <a target="_blank" href="https://lostwaysclub.itch.io/the-lighthouse-at-the-edge-of-the-universe">The Lighthouse at the Edge of the Universe</a> - In this game, you are the current keeper of the lighthouse. Whatever happens, you must keep the light running. Meant to be played before bed, I'm guessing this game isn't meant to be a plot-driven, high suspense game, so I think my mileage will be low for this one.
7. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/509657/solitary-plunder">Pirate Borg: Solitary Plunder</a> - contains solo rules for playing Pirate Borg, which I haven't yet checked out, though I have played Pirate Borg solo before. I've got a couple adventure modules I might be able to play through, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/limithron/downamongthedead">Trapped in the Topics (an intro adventure to PB), Cabin Fever (6 adventures included)</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://aaronbest.itch.io/meanwhile-somewhere-deep-in-the-dark-caribbean">Meanwhile... Somewhere Deep in the Dark Caribbean</a>.
8. <a target="_blank" href="https://byodinsbeardrpg.itch.io/runecairn-wardensaga">Runecairn Wardensaga</a> - is a lightweight, hard-hitting, combat-focused TTRPG set in a post-Ragnarok Norse fantasy world inspired by Dark Souls and Elden Ring. I'm not always a huge combat fan, but I do like action, and I've already got a 12-room tutorial dungeon adventure from <a target="_blank" href="https://byodinsbeardrpg.itch.io/beneath-the-broken-sword">Beneath the Brown Sword</a>, so I'm excited to play this one.

While I listed the games in no particular order, I suspect that the solo journaling games will be the easiest to pick up. Therefore, I'll probably start there with Evergreen Wilds and The Lighthouse at the Edge of the Universe. Then, I'll probably play Iron Valley, Ironsworn: Sundered Isles, and Pirate Borg: Solitary Plunder next since I'm already familiar with their core rulebooks. Requiring the most effort because I'm unfamiliar with them are LORDSWORN, Runecairn Wardensaga, and Wanderhome, so I'll probably get to those last unless I really feel compelled to read one day. 

Since I haven't updated my site aside from my blog in a while, I might record written playthroughs of each game for the TTRPG section of my site and link out to any oracles and tools used to facilitate play. I've found a ton of cool oracles online, and I think that might be useful in case anyone else wants to solo these games as well.

As with knitting Make Nines, I'd love to see what other folks have planned, so if you end up creating a TTRPG Play Plan, please share it! Also, if folks have any opinions on these games or tips for soloing them, please message me via Mastodon or a Neocities profile comment. My guestbook is still offline because I'm protecting my peace from anonymous opinions. Thanks for understanding!
