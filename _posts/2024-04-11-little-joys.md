**CW: food mention**

I've been spending a lot of time outdoors because the fleeting sakura season is upon us. During a recent outdoor adventure, my friend and I found out that all the wild flowers surrounding us were actually wild daikon radish plants! I began foraging the largest daikon plants I could find in the hopes of pulling a huge one out of the ground.<!--excerpt--> Most were carrot-sized due to the hard soil that doesn't allow them to easily grow large, according to online speculation. However, pulling out one that was several times the size of other daikon gave me an unparalleled sense of joy and satisfaction. Here's a photo after 45 minutes of foraging, including a hand for reference next to my prized thick daikon:

Unfortunately, the smaller ones were not really suitable for consumption because you need the wild daikon to be thick enough to be able to remove the outer layer of skin and cut away the dark, fibrous inner protective layer and still have some of the typical daikon flesh at the core. With my prized daikon, I was able to extract the core, then cut it up into thin, rounded quarters for miso soup. We were also able to peel, julienne, marinate, and microwave the skin to create a chewy but tasty snack. I delighted in the process of preparing our foraged feast like I was Senshi in an episode of Dungeon Meshi.

When I wasn't foraging with friends, I was learning about Liquid templating for this Jekyll site. I wanted to understand how a Jekyll website was able to calculate reading time for each blog post without javascript, so, after poking around a public repo, I began to understand how I could use templating to achieve that and much more. It blew my mind, and I'm really grateful to anyone who publicly shares their code repos for others to learn from.

My final and most recent little joy was discovering an <a target="_blank" href="https://hinokodo.itch.io/miru-an-analog-adventure-game">analog adventure game called MIRU</a> last night. I began playing it alone, exploring and drawing a randomly generated map while managing resources and character stats. My friend seated next to me quickly got as invested as I did in my little adventure, so we ended up playing it together, mutually deciding what to do next and how to approach challenges. It was the most captivating and fun thing I've maybe ever done to recharge and escape after a tiring, long day at work. It took me a leisurely five hours to complete in a one shot, and I can't wait to play it again.

I'm always looking for more little joys to incorporate into my life, so if you've had any recently, please share them with me!
