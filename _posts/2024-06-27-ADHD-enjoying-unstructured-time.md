Have you ever found yourself lying in bed or sitting on the couch, endlessly proposing ideas for how you could spend your weekend or other period on unstructured free time only to realize that hours have passed and you still haven’t done anything at all? As someone with ADHD, this was a frustratingly frequent experience. I finally got so fed up with this utter inability to enjoy free time that I decided to come up with a formulaic plan to avoid wasting another second of it feeling indecisive and miserable.<!--excerpt-->

My first step was to come up with some ideas for worthwhile activities that I could do that would leave me feeling energized afterwards, inspired loosely by *NICE* (Near-term, Input-based, Controllable, and Energizing) goal setting from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/">Ali Abdul’s new book, Feel Good Productivity</a>. The list ended up including some baby steps I could take towards my goals as well as random ideas that just sounded fun to me. Themes organically emerged across various items on my list, so I decided to include them here in case they inspire anyone follow along with my process. Here's my list:
## 1. Self-Development
<ol>
	<li>
		Upgrade Daily Routine: Read a self-development book, then take notes and implement something learned into your daily routine.
	</li>
	<li>
		Review and Adjust Daily Routine: Check in with your goals and ensure the daily habits and routines you’re doing are still serving those goals; adjust as necessary.
	</li>
	<li>
		Heal Inner Wounds: Meditate with Headspace for at least 10 minutes, then practice <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCJ2fBBavCJEoQPzbMIOuQ2luJDHrWPSL">Internal Family Systems therapy</a> with yourself to see which of your inner parts needs attention right now or reflect on the last time you were triggered and figure out which part(s) needed attention then.
	</li>
</ol>
## 2. Tune up
<ol>
	<li>
		Organize a closet or area, purging what you no longer need.
	</li>
	<li>
		Clean your space or yourself.
	</li>
	<li>
		Move: Stretch or take a long walk to an audiobook or podcast.
	</li>
	<li>
		Create a mood-boosting playlist or refresh an old one.
	</li>
	<li>
		Meditate: Open up headspace and complete Today’s Meditation if you don’t have any particular focus for the session. Add a candle or incense to delight your sense of smell and increase presence.
	</li>
</ol>
## 3. Creativity
<ol>
	<li>
		Watch and follow along with a pixel art (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmac3HPrav-9UWt-ahViIZxpyQxJ2wPSH">1</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxfQIomHccxvoTON6hXhfZyAUdFXd-z1P">2</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr2C_1_x89o3beJ1KTuSgMKPwsDizLvA_">3</a>) or <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Fumh49xzI0AU6Zydr6WNsdzzy9YQztB&si=W_w4U7mN3YCSZGJl">watercolor tutorial</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Write a blog post in response to a <a target="_blank" href="https://museariadne.neocities.org/prompts">creative writing prompt</a>, another person's post, or just to help organize your thoughts.
	</li>
	<li>
		Make a color-coordinated or themed Hobonichi journal spread based on a random stationery item (sticker, stamp, washi tape roll) that calls to you.
	</li>
</ol>
## 4. Fun
<ol>
	<li>
		Laugh: Watch something on <a target="_blank" href="http://dropout.tv">dropout.tv</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Read: enjoy some fiction.
	</li>
	<li>
		Adventure: Look at your Google Maps Want To Go list and go to the nearest one (clean up the list as you go).
	</li>
	<li>
		Play: solo RPG or video game.
	</li>
	<li>
		Knit on a project or plan a future project with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/">Ravelry</a>.
	</li>
</ol>
## 5. Service
<ol>
	<li>
		Do something nice for another person: bake a treat, write a letter or text, offer to do a chore for them, give them a massage, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you’re stuck on ideas, ask what they want, enjoy, or need help with.
	</li>
</ol>

Once I had built out this decently sized list, I challenged myself to pick one activity and focus on that for at least one 25-minute pomodoro timer (I use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forestapp.cc/">Forest app</a>, but there are <a target="_blank" href="https://pomofocus.io">free pomodoro timers online</a>). If I really couldn't decide where to start, I assigned each theme a number, rolled a virtual die with that many values, then repeated that with the bulleted ideas underneath the selected category. I kept cycling through categories and activities until I felt satisfied, started hyper-fixating, or ran out of unstructured time. I noticed that I not only felt energized by doing these activities, but I also felt a sense of accomplishment and joy. 

I'd love to hear how other folks with ADHD deal with or make the most of unstructured time, so drop a webmention, reach out via my guestbook, or write a response on your own blog and send me the link.
