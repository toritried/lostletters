This is my response to the fourth prompt from the [muse ariadne](https://museariadne.neocities.org/) writing club: *write about echoes, sound, and reverberation. what is an echo– just sound or something more? how can it reverberate through past, present, and future? can emotion be an echo in that way? what else can be?*<!--excerpt-->

I sit at the end of an infinite hallway in my mind. Echoes from the past travel to me from the many doors on either side. Some doors I know well because I've opened them dozens of times to recall a hilarious memory to amuse others. Countless others that have been lost, unable to open, silenced. Some doors reverberate with such vicious sounds that I don't even dare approach. 

To know the contents behind each door is to be familiar with the sound of its echo, to have memorized its essence carried through space and time. Nearly all the echoes stem from moments where I hung onto every word someone said to me. Given the human propensity to cling to the negative, I have spent many days trying to listen for quieter echoes amidst a painful cacophony. Other days, I don't even try, letting the sounds crash over me.

I have only escaped this hallway once in my life. It was a sunny California afternoon, and I was seated in one of a dozen occupied ergonomic office chairs in a conference room, listening intently to meditation cues from my coworker. He asked us to observe all the thoughts and echoes of our minds and any sensations we could perceive, then picture them in bubbles that float up and out of our consciousness. After a few minutes, he asked us to zoom out and observe ourselves observing the bubbles. For the briefest moment, I transcended myself to join infinity. It was overwhelming to be part of something I couldn't comprehend the vastness of, but it was also calm, solitary and most profoundly silent.
