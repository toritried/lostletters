This was originally posted to my Now page, but I'm moving all of those updated to the blog. Here's what I got up to this week:<!--excerpt-->

<ul>
    <li><b>Making:</b> so many <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct08pcoyAiA/">yarn cozies</a> and <a href="/2023/06/24/summer-knitting.html">summer tops</a></li>
    <li><b>Listening to:</b> all the knitting podcasts on YouTube! I feel like there's a huge new crop of knitting podcasts from the pandemic. I haven't watched knitting podcasts since 2018, so it's really cool to see more diversity.</li>
    <li><b>Reading:</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250826794/witchking">Witch King by Martha Wells</a> - I loved Wells' Murderbot series, so I decided to try her recent fantasy release. It's quite different than her other work, but I'm enjoying it so far.</li>
    <li><b>Celebrating:</b> getting a bunch of new dresses that make me feel cute as heck, which is a very rare experience both in terms of finding clothes off the rack as a <a target="_blank" href="https://fluffykittenparty.com/2021/06/01/fategories-understanding-smallfat-fragility-the-fat-spectrum/">small fat</a> person in Japan and feeling cute despite body dysmorphia.</li>
    <li><b>Looking forward to:</b> traveling Europe next month to scout for possible new places to live with my partner. We've got a bunch of great, vegan-friendly places on the list, and I'm hoping we have a great first impressions.</li>
</ul>
