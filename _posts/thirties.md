There are so many videos on youtube looking back on ## things a person learned before turning ## that I do feel like it's perhaps worth writing out some of these things, but I want to focus on what lessons I've learned that I want to carry into my thirties. 

1) **before you blame yourself first, blame the approach.** 
2) **Progress sometimes is just time passing**. This is obvious for things like avoiding a relapse or incident, but it's also true for just still surviving on this planet. Plateaus can also be progress because you're holding on. 
3) **do not ignore bad feelings even if they're small** Getting help in my 20s for so many health related issues was critical to getting support and finding a path towards a healthier future. 
Things I want to work on:
1. learning not to reparent myself, so I can treat trauma.
2. Gain and practice with more emotional regulation tools
3. Heal my relationship to food
4. Try running competitively again to push myself outside of my comfort zone
