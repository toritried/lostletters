I am once <a href="/2023/04/24/self-respect.html">again</a> setting a yearly theme based on CGP Grey's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">Your Theme video</a>. A yearly theme guides how I will approach 2024 as I navigate all its future unknowns. Instead of setting a binary resolution like "run a marathon" (which only has two states: success or failure), I will be defining my year as the **Year of Accountabililty** such that any decisions I make in service of my broad theme count as progress.<!--excerpt-->
<br>
<br>
I crave consistent progress; however, I really struggle with consistency as I'm still learning to manage bipolar disorder and ADHD. I want to give myself grace and room for that. **Holding myself accountable when I'm not consistent will allow me to understand and address my needs more quickly and effectively**. Accountability has a lot of harsh connotations, but I plan to approach it with compassionate curiosity for myself even though my brain's default is set to a truly astounding amount of relentless and unfettered self-loathing. In practice, **compassionate curiosity could look like gently asking myself why** don't I feel like running today, so I can sit with whatever challenges, fears, and doubts arise until they relax their chokehold on my mind. I'm going to be spending a lot of my time interrogating my choices and intentions, and reminding myself that more of the time, **I have the privilege of choosing which type of hard I want to experience in life**. With that, I will be trying to actively challenge my sense of <a href="/2023/09/05/learned-helplessness.html">learned helplessness</a>. Ultimately, I hope this helps me come up with creative solutions to keep reaching for what I want out of life despite whatever tries to stop me.

With the theme in mind, here are a few hobby-related targets and actions for 2024, which accountability should enable:
<br>
<br>
Target: Run Faster -> Action: I will complete running and strength workouts according to plans from the Runna App that are geared toward improving my 5k time. I will adjust the schedule as needed to live a balanced and sustainable life. I will listen to my body and treat any injuries or illnesses quickly and responsibly. For the numbers-inclined, my most recent 5k time was 41:41 as of Nov 12, and the Runna app estimates that I'll be able to run that anywhere between 36:15 to 38:20 after their 8 week training plan. If I can get to a sub-36:00 5k (7:12/km), then I will start running Parkruns weekly. My ultimate goal is to run a sub-30:00 5k (6:00/km). While this seems like the biggest stretch right now, I'm excited to see where I'll get after a year of accountability.

Target: Keep Reading -> Action: Keep sourcing fantasy and sci fi book recommendations from YouTube and book awards, so that I can find at least 20 intriguing books to enjoy in 2024 (any length; DNF do not count). I would also like to carve out weekly eBook reading time, so I can complete at least one book on my eReader.
<br>
<br>
Target: Keep Documenting -> Action: I will maintain a sustainable daily journaling practice by using the following journals and planners:

- A Hobonichi Weeks daily for rapid logging of what happened each day
- A Hobonichi A6 Daily for daily creative expression collages and memory keeping
- A Nolty 2316 for daily priorities to help me stay focused

At this time, I don't have web development nor knitting targets. If I were to have targets for each, they would be to learn javascript and knit at least three sweaters next year. I don't want to bite off too much at the start though, so we'll see how I fare with my current set of targets and actions before taking on more.
