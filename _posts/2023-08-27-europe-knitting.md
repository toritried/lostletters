I went on a trip to Europe to find a suitable future home just to end up realizing that no where is perfect.<!--excerpt-->  There were so many things that were easier or nicer there:
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Being fluent again</b> - it's such a relief when you can ask someone for help or just feel confident when you're ordering food that your dietary needs will be met. It was so easy to fall back into English that I wasn't even worried that someone wouldn't speak English no matter where we went.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Having vegan food readily available</b> - food scarcity due to a lack of accessible vegan options in Japan has really fucked up my relationship with food, and I hate it. I've turned down semi-spontaneous trips because I didn't have enough time to research and/or prep my own food. It was so nice seeing vegan food advertised on every street in Berlin. I was blown away. It was so much better than California or really any other place I've been. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Size-inclusive clothing</b> - I got to try on clothes with my girlfriend in a store thanks to there being clothes for small fats like me. The subway seats were also generally wider than in Japan, so I felt more comfortable there too. Given I already have a shit relationship with my flesh suit, Japan ensures I will never feel "normal" in a fat body because I never am able to shop for clothes in stores here.
    </li>
</ol>
<br>
Of course, it wasn't all good compared to Japan, but those quality of life improvements ultimately outweigh any of the cons I'm about to mention, so I really hope I don't offend any folks who live in these cities as I'd like to be neighbors one day. Here's what bothered me: so many people smoked cigarettes, souring many outdoor dining experiences for us. We also couldn't leave our windows open in Vienna because of people smoking as they walked by. Aside from two exceptions, the customer service was extremely harsh and negative in Vienna. I was often left wondering if I had done something wrong to ruin that person's day. Many people in Vienna and Berlin were extremely loud in public, even on the subways, talking on their phones or to each other. However, in Cologne and Amsterdam, people were much more quiet, which was appreciated. It was also much dirtier than Tokyo despite far fewer people, and public restrooms and tap water were not free, which is truly strange considering how those are basic human necessities and health care, also a necessity, is free in these countries. Lot of these things were perplexing and different, and I've accepted that culture shock will always be a thing when moving internationally.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, it was a good trip (<a target="_blank" href="https://cutie.city/@lostletters/110811217935581731">I kept a daily log on Mastodon for half of it</a>), and I got so much knitting done. I set a goal to knit the <a target="_blank_" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/ranunculus-3">Ranunculus
by Midori Hirose</a> in every city I visited using souvenir yarn from that city because it only takes me three to four days to knit it, which is really good for a whole sweater. If you <a target="_blank" href="https://cutie.city/@lostletters">follow me on Mastodon</a>, you already know how this story ends, but I ended up being able to complete my challenge on top of knitting two bralettes and a whole turtleneck sweater as well! Here are the sweaters from each city:

This is first one: my Vienna Ranunculus. On our first day in Vienna, I picked up two skeins (800m) of Das Mondschaf yarn in the colorway Cersei at Wollmeile in Wien. The shop owner didn't speak much English, but we managed. I almost left the shop before remembering that I needed to turn the yarn into cakes, so I could knit with it immediately. I ran back in to try to explain, and the shop owner allowed me to use her ball winder and swift to cake up the yarn. I still can't believe I almost forgot that crucial step. 
<br>
<br>
This sweater turned out amazing, and I'm so glad I now know just how far two skeins of fingering-weight yarn will get me with this pattern. I was definitely off from the recommended gauge (stitches per inch), but I think it produced a lovely fabric regardless. Depending on how it's blocked, it can fit my girlfriend (pictured above) or me, which is wild considering we are such different sizes.

While I technically knit this using souvenir yarn from Vienna, I knit this Ranunculus in Berlin, so it still counts for the challenge. This one is a summer top with short sleeves because the fiber content is 50% cotton, 50% bamboo viscose. My girlfriend is also modeling this one, but it grows easily to fit me as well, considering the fiber content is prone to getting much larger with wear.

This last Ranunculus is very special (and expensive T__T). It is made of Artemis Yarns, which I purchased at the famous Stephen & Penelope shop in Amsterdam for a truly wild price of â‚¬111.00 for 3 skeins (1095 m). They were the last three skeins of that color in the shop, and I simply couldn't resist the colorway. I tried in vain to compare that yarn to any others in the shop for at least 30 minutes, looking for a cheaper alternative. The kind ladies in the store caked all three up for me, and that's when I realized there was a significant difference in one skein versus the other two. I was hoping it wouldn't be a problem, but I ended up having to rip out some of my work to start over and then alternate it with the two other skeins to knit the entire body and both arms in order to evenly distribute the dark speckles. It wasn't as hard as I thought, but I definitely did have some tension issues where I switched which yarn I was using. It blocked out okay after a quick soak, so it doesn't bother me in the final product. This was my first time having to alternate, and I'm very proud of how well I did. All that work was definitely worth it.

Here's the bonus sweater, which is knit according to the 
<a taget="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/metropolis-3">Metropolis pattern by Tanis Lavallee</a>. I fell in love with this rainbow nep tweed yarn before I had a pattern in mind, so I had to frantically search Ravelry for a pattern to justify it and also figure how much I should buy. I've never seen this yarn nor brand sold elsewhere, so I just happened to get extremely lucky. It makes me feel like a whole wheat funfetti cupcake, which is something I need to feel much more often.

<br>
On top of these sweaters, I bought sweater-quanities of yarn for at least 10 of the projects on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/people/foolishfibers/queue">ravelry queue</a>, so I ended up spending so much money. I really cannot purchase anymore yarn this year, especially since my hyperfixation has moved to tamagotchi immediately after this trip, and they are so much more expensive than you might think. I really wish that had not happened, but now I find myself trying to keep three pixel pets happy, alive, and clean throughout the day. It's so fun though, and I'm making it my whole personality. I ended up making a <a href="/tamagotchi/">shrine for these cute characters</a> for the <a target="_blank" href="https://tilde.32bit.cafe/~hermit/community_jam_2/">32bit.cafe Community Code Jam #2</a>.
