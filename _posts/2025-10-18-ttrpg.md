One of the best things about moving back to the US has been finding a tabletop role-playing game community that doesn't just offer tables for D&D 5E. As a result, this year alone, I've played 58 TTRPG sessions across 19 different games (15 were new to me), so I wanted to review them while they're mostly still fresh in my mind.<!--excerpt-->

After rating all these games, a few things became clear: I have a strong preference for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/feature/what-is-osr-old-school-rpg-classic-dnd">Old School Renaissance (OSR) games</a>, but I don't think OSR games work particularly well for long-term campaigns because of how deadly they are. I'm open to having my mind changed on that front with the right game master at the helm as I do tend to prefer campaign style of play. I also strongly prefer games that emphasize exploration, so games that were mostly just roleplay didn't rank as highly for me. Finally, I wanted to just add a little disclaimer that I do not want to throw any shade to any of the game masters who have run the low scoring games for me. I have the utmost respect for them. I just didn't vibe with some of these games or GM styles, and that's totally okay. I love that there's something for everyone here in this hobby.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://chrismcdee.itch.io/mythic-bastionland">Mythic Bastionland</a> | 1 one-shot  
This game is dark and horrifying in a serious way (as opposed to MORK BORG which can get a bit silly). Every single hex we crawled held a situation or scenario so provocative and intriguing, we felt compelled to abandon our main quest at every turn just to try to understand and explore what was going on. Exploration, as compared to role-play and combat, is my favorite element of TTRPGs, so this was going to get me every time. 

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/brindlewood-bay.html">Brindlewood Bay</a> | 2 one-shots  
I was impressed by this murder mystery game where you collect clues and arrange them into a narrative that explains how the murder happened. The more clues you use, the easier the ultimate dice roll is to determine if you were correct in your assumption of how the murder went down. The game somewhat suffers as a one-shot because you can't really do anything with clues you get when rolling as 12+ on 2d6 that get at a greater overarching mystery at work that spans sessions, which is why I'm taking off one star as I've not had the chance to play campaign style.

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.troikarpg.com/">Troika!</a> | 1 one-shot  
Fellow emergent, whimsical fantasy lovers unite! This is still my favorite rules-lite OSR. It feels like nothing is out of play, and your creativity can just run wild here. OSRs aren't perfect though, and I'm not really convinced they lend themselves to campaigns because they're so deadly, but if you want a wildly good time, I'd recommend everyone check out Troika!, specifically <a target="_blank" href="https://usa.soulmuppet-store.co.uk/products/the-stygian-library">The Stygian Library</a>, which is a randomly generated dungeon. 

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://freeleaguepublishing.com/games/cy_borg/">CY_BORG</a> | 1 one-shot  
OSR with anti-capitalist, anti-carceral cyberpunks, what's not to love? The world of CY_BORG is extremely evocative, and I have fond memories playing aquatic-human hybrid punks for a one-shot, trying to take down a loan shark. I'd love to play this again especially given how much creative momentum there is behind all the "BORG" style games. 

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/pages/mothership-rpg">Mothership</a> | 2 one-shots, 2 campaign sessions  
The OSR modules and bespoke adventures I've played really impressed me. I've never felt so ill at ease and worried when playing a game like when I'm at a mothership table. The stakes are high; the world is deadly; and you've got a mission to complete come aliens, interstellar parasites, yellow ooze, or whatever else your DM throws at you.

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://possumcreekgames.com/pages/yazebas-bed-breakfast">Yazeba’s Bed & Breakfast</a> | 2 one-shots  
This game really opened my eyes to the breadth of what TTRPGs can offer. Before 'zeeb's, I had never played a game that was almost all roleplay without much emphasis on exploration or combat, which isn't always what I'm in the mood for to be honest. I was a fish out of water at my first one-shot, but I caught on quickly and even purchased the game to run with friends at my home. I would love to explore more of this game in a campaign format, so I could unlock scenarios with prerequisites. I doubt I'll get there though because it does require a full complement of folks to play the cast of characters, so it's not something I could play solo. 

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://storybrewersroleplaying.com/good-society/?v=0b3b97fa6688">Good Society</a> | 1 one-shot, 3 campaign sessions (dating show hack)  
I spent a lot of time with friends, thinking about how to make the dating show hack of this game work, but ultimately I didn't think there was enough in terms of mechanics to make skill challenges, a classic for so much of reality tv, work. I got why Aabria Iyengar paired this with D&D on Dimension 20 for A Court of Fey and Flowers. I am a bit intimidated to play this in the pure traditional sense because I don't have a ton of familiarity with the inspiration material (Jane Austen), but the dating show hack (with secret gay and pan characters) was such a fun time.

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://evilhat.com/product/blades-in-the-dark/">Blades in the Dark</a> | 9 campaign sessions   
Blades is such a classic, player-driven experience. I love it, but sometimes it feels like there's not enough variety between heists. I fully admit though that that's my fault for not coming more inspired and prepared as this game is our filler when we don't have the full crew to play Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. 

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-edge-of-the-empire/">Star Wars: Edge of the Empire</a> | 4 campaign sessions  
I wish I was playing more of this this year. We've almost escaped off the first planet we crash-landed more than a year ago (in real time) because scheduling has been a nightmare for six folks across three time zones. This is an excellent game for long-term campaigns. Since we started in December of 2023, we've played 19 sessions, 18 of which were on the same planet because our GM is so wonderfully talented at making the world feel massive as well as creating intriguing plot hooks and quests. I love that Daggerheart took inspiration from the light and dark side points for the hope and fear mechanic. The Edge of the Empire dice system would be completely opaque to me without the online website that tallies things for us, so I'm taking off one star for that.

⭐⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://mausritter.com/">Mausritter</a> | 1 one-shot + 4 campaign sessions  
Another deadly OSR game, but I'm having fun playing it in a mini-campaign format using the <a target="_blank" href="https://manadawnttg.itch.io/tomb-of-a-thousand-doors-deluxe">Tomb of a Thousand Doors mega-dungeon</a>. We're still relatively early in the campaign, but I think this would be best as a one-shot. We'll see if this one game can't change my mind about OSR not being too deadly for longer-term play.

⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.myth.works/collections/the-wildsea-homepage">Wildsea</a> | 11 campaign sessions  
Wildsea's worldbuilding is evocative. It's a post-fall fantasy game set in tree ocean with ships that navigate it with chainsaws. Combat is looser than I'd like though, and I haven't spent the time wrapping my mind around all the rules as we're playing a GM-less campaign. There have been many moments where we've referenced the rules and left just as confused, so I'm taking off two points for that.

⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://morkborg.com/">MORK BORG</a> | 1 one shot, 4 campaign sessions  
While I enjoy this game for one-shots, leveling up in such a deadly environment is nearly impossible, so I think I'll stick to one-shots or short, solo campaign play for this. Every instance of this has been a bit too dark that it's wrapped around to being too silly to have any stakes to things.

⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://hecticelectron.itch.io/raccoon-sky-pirates">Racoon Sky Pirates</a> | 1 one-shot  
Not intended for campaigns, but perfect for a silly one-shot with friends who enjoy shenaniganry.

⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://thornygames.com/pages/dialect">Dialect: A Game About Language and How It Dies</a> | 1 one-shot  
Really interesting role-playing game that requires you to improvise terms and phrases that get incorporated into your lexicon. I feel like conlangers would go nuts with this game. All roleplay, no combat or exploration as far as I can recall.

⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.daggerheart.com/">Daggerheart</a> | 2 one-shots  
This probably shines as a campaign, but my one-shot experiences left me feeling like it was too adjacent to D&D to be emergent enough for me, which can obviously vary depending on how much time you have to play, how large the table is, and what the DM's style is like. 

⭐⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://heartofthedeernicorn.com/product/beak-feather-bone/?v=0b3b97fa6688">Beak Feather and Bone</a> | 1 one-shot  
This collaborative map and lore-making game has a competitive stake-claiming element to it as well. I could see it be really great for some foundational worldbuilding to set a campaign in, but this is best as a one-shot.

⭐⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.hauntedtable.games/">Triangle Agency</a> | 1 one-shot  
Unlike Brindlewood Bay, it seemed like there was a GM preferred or pre-defined solution for solving the situation (capturing the anomaly) that my team tried to creatively achieve, but ultimately failed. It was very unsatisfying, and I prefer emergent game play over pre-defined solutions. It could have just been that the GM's style was different than my preference though. It would be generous of me to give this game a second one-shot chance with a different GM.

⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://freeleaguepublishing.com/games/dragonbane/">Dragonbane</a> | 1 tournament  
I played this as part of a tournament where each table competed to solve or beat the same dungeon with various other dimensions about our creativity scored as well. Some of the dungeon puzzles lacked any scaffolding/clues to solve which was frustrating even though we got 2nd place in this tournament. The poor module design really soured things for me, so I'm not keen on exploring this one again even though I should give it a second shot as I normally like Free League games.

⭐ | <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&D</a> West Marches | 2 sessions  
Due to the nature of everyone wanting to level up in West Marches, the sessions felt a bit cookie cutter: small fight -> boss fight -> loot -> update EXP sheets and done. I'm just over playing D&D at this point.
