*Beachcomber* is my response to the June 3rd prompt from the <a target="_blank" href="https://museariadne.neocities.org/">muse ariadne</a> writing club: *think about undercurrents as you writeâ€“ movements and energies that flow beneath surfaces. what surfaces do they lay beneath? is it an undertone in skin or a song, a literal current, a political movement?*<!--excerpt-->

Something within called to me, disturbing my violent drifting slumber. I had grown used to the infinite numbness and the directionless current that pulled me. Every attempt to break free further resigned me to these depths. Yet, here was a harbinger of another attempt, a flame no bigger than the end of a match. "Would one more attempt be so bad?" I wondered to myself as I began to tend the tiny flame. My mind, thoughts, and body began to move in surprisingly synchronized orchestration. I was transfixed by my own unfamiliar coordination, and days bled into weeks. When I finally broke my gaze, I looked up at an impossible horizon with an even more impossible shore. My strange locomotion brought me there in an instant, hands pawing at the sand. This deserted place was not on my map for I had no map, and there were no signs either--just an endless beach, stretching to either side.

I picked a direction at random, and began to walk. With each step, I noticed the feeling of striking the firm, wet sand with my feet until it gave way under my weight. Step by step, I established a slow rhythm, which was occasionally punctuated by little discoveries amidst the sand. Lessons I had learned years ago had washed up on the shore. When had these slipped from the possession of my consciousness? I turned each truth over in my palm, grateful for something familiar in this new place. "At least you're here with me now," I whispered as much to them as myself.
