I've had a rough few weeks since my last post characterized by intensifying feelings of depression, loneliness, and anxiety. I've finally managed to get appointments with a new therapist and psychiatrist next week, so I'm going to be fine as help is on the way, but I wanted to document a few strategies I've been using to help me get through this rough patch. None of the following strategies are a substitute for qualified medical support though, and everyone should <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts/">get crisis support if needed</a>. This is just what's been helping me:<!--excerpt-->

**Stopping the start of a spiral: stay off mainstream social media, especially at night** 
I'm more emotional at night, and I have no way to channel that productively when I'm supposed to be going to bed. If I get agitated during the day, I can at least use the 5 calls app to contact my reps, protest, volunteer, etc. I also find that the excuse of needing to doomscroll so I can stay plugged into the news doesn't really hold water. When I volunteer, organizers inform me of the news and latest threats to a cause, and getting the news from them is much less overwhelming and much more actionable. Getting upset and feeling hopeless while I read news on my phone in bed late at night does not meaningfully advance any causes, so there's no reason why I should be doing this. Better to spend all that scroll time getting actually involved in making the world a better place.

**Getting back in control: temporarily halt overwhelming thoughts with meditation**
Due to some glitch or oversight, I still have a paid headspace account, so I've been using that to find meditations relevant to whatever feeling threatens to overwhelm me in the moment. The app just keeps prompting me to bring attention to my breath, do a body scan, notice things with my senses around me, or send loving kindness to myself and others, which feels kind of like a grift; however, I'm not paying for it anymore, and it's effective enough, so I keep using it. After just ten minutes or less of meditation, I usually feel that the overwhelm has diffused to the point where I can start improving my mental situation through movement. If I'm still feeling overwhelmed, I just pick one after another until I don't anymore.

**Short-term relief through movement**
I haven't been running lately, but weight lifting and walking have felt somewhat accessible. I've been following a free <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B12MXF0bSFo&ab_channel=JeremyEthier">lifting program that's based on a meta-analysis of the most effective exercises for building muscle</a>. I followed the previous iteration of this workout based on research from a few years ago and created visible biceps for the first time in my life, so I'm excited about the updated version. Anyways, doing this workout requires me to focus on my form for about 30 minutes, and that shift in mental focus away from anxiety persists far beyond the last rep. Walking is a little less effective than lifting because I don't really need to maintain proprioceptive awareness while doing it (thus allowing my mind more opportunity to wander back towards rumination), but I throw on an engaging podcast like Behind the Bastards and rid my mind of the bad feelings for an hour. Both forms of exercise create mental bandwidth needed to course correct the trajectory of my day away from sad bed rotting. 

**Longer-term relief by being in community**
Whether I hang out in the chat of a friend's stream, volunteer, or play games with friends over discord, being in community is the most powerful antidote to my loneliness. It turns my attention away from inner turmoil and toward the outside world and all the people and causes I care about. After being in community, I experience the strongest and most persistent mood boost that far surpasses what I get from solo endeavors.

I don't really know how to end this post, but if you've read this far and you're struggling right now too, I see you. It sucks so much, but you're not alone. We're not alone. These feelings are just temporary, and it's going to get better. Let's hang in there together. ðŸ«‚
