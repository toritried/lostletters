This is a poem called *An Elephant Never Forgets*, which I wrote for the third prompt from the [muse ariadne](https://museariadne.neocities.org/) writing club: *fuck salvador dali for being evil. that said, write a piece inspired by two famous dali paintings-- [persistence of memory](https://i.postimg.cc/Rq5xwH5d/persistenceofmemory.jpg) and [the elephants](https://i.postimg.cc/cL3rqRLx/theelephants.jpg).*

on stilted legs, we waver
balancing monumental baggage
a few precarious steps from
a pool of time that melts and bends 
of indeterminable depths that telescopically extend
peering at its mirrored surface just to see
all this too has been added to our backs
the punishing weight is all too sudden
we are frozen in a test of suffering

The prompt inspired me to reflect on the disorienting and confusing trials and trauma of relationships, the nature of which felt mirrored in Persistence of Memory. I wanted to examine the perspective of the beasts of burden in The Elephants because I found their precarity relatable as I navigated my own complex and strained relationships over the past week.
