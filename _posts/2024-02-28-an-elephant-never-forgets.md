This is a poem called *An Elephant Never Forgets*, which I wrote for the third prompt from the [muse ariadne](https://museariadne.neocities.org/) writing club: *fuck salvador dali for being evil. that said, write a piece inspired by two famous dali paintings-- [persistence of memory](https://i.postimg.cc/Rq5xwH5d/persistenceofmemory.jpg) and [the elephants](https://i.postimg.cc/cL3rqRLx/theelephants.jpg).*<!--excerpt-->

on stilted legs, we waver
<br>balancing monumental baggage
<br>a few precarious steps from
<br>a pool of time that melts and bends 
<br>of indeterminable depths that telescopically extend
<br>peering at its mirrored surface just to see
<br>all this too has been added to our backs
<br>the punishing weight is all too sudden
<br>we are frozen in a test of suffering

The prompt inspired me to reflect on the disorienting and confusing trials and trauma of relationships, the nature of which felt mirrored in Persistence of Memory. I wanted to examine the perspective of the beasts of burden in The Elephants because I found their precarity relatable as I navigated my own complex and strained relationships over the past week.
