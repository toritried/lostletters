I am thoroughly exhausted from two back-to-back trips (Hong Kong & <a target="_blank" href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3478.html">Shimanami Kaido</a>) with the future in-laws, but I can't retire the tour guide hat since my own family has just arrived in Japan too. It's a wild coincidence to have both our families here at the same time, and my partner and I are trying to load balance hosting and logistics as best we can. I marvel at her patience.

Last week, we went to Hong Kong (my first time), where I was blown away by how accessible the city was in terms of veganism and English support. The latter shouldn't have been that surprising given the history of colonization, but I think I've just been traumatized by the lack of English support in Japan. The vegan food far exceeded my expectations, but the stationery scene was a thorough disappointment (aside from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.funcolorhk.com/">funcolor</a>, that shop was great). The 28C or higher temperatures made the trip a total sweat fest, which made me even more deeply appreciate how lucky we got with the weather for our second trip: biking Shimanami Kaido.

<br>
Over the course of two days, I fulfilled a four-year old dream of cycling 80Â km from Onomichi to Imabari. What was originally forecasted to be a two-day slog through the rain ended up being a perfectly sunny and pleasant cycle. The sun dazzled across the Seto Inland Sea as we crossed suspension bridges and gazed upon the numerous and stunning rocky island outcroppings surrounded by turquoise waters. 
<br>
<br>
On day two, we encountered a Japanese man in his 70s, wearing slacks, a button up, and roller skates, who was roller-skating across the entire 70km+ route. I asked him how he handled the terrifyingly fast descents (-5% grade) from the bridges, and he simply said that fear cannot be helped. What a badass. I hope when I'm his age, I hope to have a fraction of his fearlessness and physical ability. 
<br>
<br>
Another surprise on the trip was how many restaurants and cafes were willing to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Despite deep internet searches for any vegan crumbs along this cycle route, I found nothing in my trip preparations, so I dutifully purchased emotional support/emergency snack yaki imo (roasted sweet potato) from Donki before we headed out. However, my Japanese was surprisingly sufficient to communicate my need for culinary substitutions, so I did not starve! Furthermore, I also did not get sunburned nor eaten by mosquitoes, so I actually had so many wins on this trip, I can hardly believe it. I finished the cycle feeling proud for having come so far with the cycle and Japanese proficiency.

You'd expect that I'd be riding high after such a trip, but I'm honestly a bit ragged at the moment. Long days of biking and helping with logistics and Japanese for my partner's family are things I'm happy to do, but they wear me out compared to my usual, chilled out life at home. It's nice just to have this moment to write out my longer form thoughts while I have the home to myself for an hour. Thank you for indulging me in this.
