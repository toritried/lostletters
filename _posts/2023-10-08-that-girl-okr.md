This past week, I officially started my long-term sick leave from work. The healing and inner work I need to do during this leave is uncharted territory for me, so, in addition to getting professional, qualified help, I've tried to formulate a daily routine to aid my recovery and avoid stagnating in overwhelm.<!--excerpt--> Since I can't turn off my work-pilled brain, I accidentally created an OKR (<i>inexcusable, I know</i>) for what I want to achieve during my sick leave: 
<br>
<br>
Get back to a holistically healthy state by the end of the year *as measured by* 
<ol>
	<li>consistently exercising</li>
	<li>mindfully eating anytime I eat (instead of frantically regulating my emotions with food)</li>
	<li>consistently engaging with activities/hobbies that I enjoy</li>
</ol>
<br>
To achieve these key results, I'm cultivating the following daily habits:
<ul>
	<li><b>Journal</b> - set my intention for the day, then craft and visualize my daily plan by answering the prompt: how do I want to feel physically and mentally today, and what actions can I add to my day to help with this? Write until I've filled at least one A6 page.</li>
	<li><b>Meditate</b> - practice mindfulness by use my subscription to headspace to complete at least one meditation of any duration.</li>
	<li><b>Exercise</b> - alternate between workout days (30+ mins of running, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JmWguyvu7Y&list=PLXFVbuJY5qGpFzJ7i-AhREynwF7VdUFUy">lifting based on research meta-analyses</a>, TRX) and low-intensity steady state cardio days (30+ mins of walking) to ensure I take consistent rest and don't trigger an all-or-nothing mentality.</li>
	<li><b>Physical Therapy</b> - complete the sets and reps assigned to me by my podiatrist to avoid re-injury that would limit/prohibit daily exercise.</li>
	<li><b>Study</b> - work through the <a target="_blank" href="https://itsryannnicole.com/hfm">Hunger and Fullness Masterclass by Ryann Nicole</a>; rinse and repeat. </li>
</ul>
<br>
Completing that list everyday this past week took a lot of will power, but it was made easier by actually doing even more. The following habits helped me build momentum, enabling me to psych myself up to tackle the harder things on the previous list:
<ul>
	<li><b>Read for fun</b> - any book, any duration, any format. Read through my <a target="_blank" href="https://cutie.city/@lostletters/111160178171394271">anti-capitalist and union/collective bargaining book list</a>. Track it with <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/lostletters">The Story Graph</a>. </li>
<li><b>Skin care routine</b> - this is just an easy self-care win as I tend to give up on my skin when I'm depressed. I looked into what <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loUjg47Osoc">dermatologists recommend to reduce pores</a>, then specifically sought out products for my skin type. It's only been three weeks, but I'm already seeing an improvement, so I've got a positive feedback cycle going now. </li>
</ul>
<br>
Echoing my past post on my health, it's easy to get overwhelmed and think that things are actually getting worse, but I don't believe that. Although I do have more diagnoses now than ever before, I'm clearer than ever on what I want to treat and how to go about that. I've learned how to avoid setting unhealthy and unreasonable goals, and my capacity to achieve them is greater than ever thanks to the treatments I'm already receiving. It's been a month since my post on learned helplessness, and it's exciting to see how much agency I've reclaimed just by shifting my mindset since then. Here's to happier and healthier futures! ðŸ¥‚
