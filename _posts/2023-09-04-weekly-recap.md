I was going to update my now page, but these always end up getting so long that I'm going to permanently move these to my blog. Here's what I got up to this week:

<!--excerpt-->
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Finished collecting tamagotchi devices (for now?)</b> - Since I figured out how to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://mixing-meets.com/">fan-revived app for the Tamagotchi meets devices</a>, I've been able to find really cute partners for my tamas, including device-exclusive tama types. This means I really don't need to keep buying new devices to run just for those tamas, so I feel wholly satisfied with the devices and characters I have at the moment. Plus, running three tamagotchi devices concurrently can be a little overwhelming at times, so I'm officially going on a tama device buying ban this month. I'll still buy collab merch if I really like it as well as protective items like screen protectors as I want to protect the investments I've made in obtaining these little guys. I did tempt myself by checking out the new <a target="_blank" href="https://meqri.com/shop/pages/tamagotchi_lp">MEQRI x Tamagotchi collaboration items</a> in Shibuya, but I didn't buy anything. I know Thank You Mart is restocking their tama collab items this month, so I look forward to getting some stuff from that if I can.

    <b>Started pursuing Italian citizenship</b> - I've been interested in getting dual Italian citizenship for a while, but it can cost between $6,000-$13,000 to get help from companies that aggregate, translate, and apostille all the necessary documents, depending on how distant your generational connection to Italy is. According to some Reddit searches, it looks like people have done it themselves for about $1500, which is still so expensive; however, paperwork is like an impossible final boss for me, so I'm not sure I can actually do this myself.
  </li>

    <b>Updated my mental health medication</b> - It's has only been a few days, but I'm not noticing any negative side effects. I'm just a bit more sleepy, but increasing how much I sleep is always great for my heart rate variability, so I'm fine with this. The cost of the augmented prescriptions gave me sticker shock, so I'm looking into how to get a medical prescription subsidy. With National Health Insurance, I currently pay 30% of the total price, but, with the subsidy, I would only have to pay for 10%. The issue is that in order to get this subsidy, I need to collect, fill out, and pay for a bunch of bureaucratic paperwork, which again is laughably impossible for me with ADHD. Why does so much of what I want require paperwork?

    <b>At-home laser hair removal</b> - I hate body hair, and I was cursed with more than I want, so I'm so excited to have started using a BRAUN Silk-expert Pro 5. This will be much cheaper in the long-run than going to the skin clinic where I've had laser done in the past. Now that my hair is so much thinner and sparse than when I started, this device is more for maintenance than anything else. My girlfriend said that the reviews of this device were actually quite positive, so we got it once it was on sale at Costco. I really feel like it's hard to get unsponsored reviews of IPL devices, especially on YouTube, so I'll share updates here on the progress in future weekly logs.
