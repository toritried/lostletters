Another month has rolled around, and I still don't have an ambitious project that inspires creative passion within me. It feels like I've been watching the garden of my mind for an eternity without anything sprouting forth, so it's time to bring a gentle end to this winter-like depression. I've decided to just start scattering seeds around and tending to them, wholly unattached to the outcome. There is value and joy in simply tending to one's creative pursuits.<!--excerpt-->

Taking inventory of the seeds that have done well in my mental garden historically, I have a modest list of consistent sources of inspiration: solo/duet TTRPGs, this website, stationery/collaging, and streaming. 

In the current season of my life, I have a few limitations, which I will work around:
1. I don't feel like being seen at the moment, so I don't want to start streaming again just yet. I'll check back in in a week.
2. Not all of my stationery supplies have arrived from Japan yet. I know constraints breed creativity, so I'll just work with what I have.
3. I don't have the capacity to do things well at the moment, but that's why I'm taking this gentle approach that's unattached to the outcome. I suspect this capacity will grow through the act of tending if past trends hold true.

Here are a few ways I'm excited to tend to my seeds this week:
- **solo/duet TTRPGs**: finish reading and annotating the Ironsworn: Starforged Rulebook PDF before I kick off a new duet campaign (using <a target="_blank" href="https://starforged-crew-link.scottbenton.dev/">this amazing digital campaign manager tool</a>) on Thursday with a friend
- **this website**: 
	- add emoji reactions to my site with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.benji.dog/articles/interactions-or-reactions/">this</a> as an alternative to tinylytics
	- write a "gardening update" on how the tending went
- **stationery/collaging**: photograph or practice short-form recording with my new camera to share my current supplies and logging methods

In the gentle spirit of this exercise, I'm not going to worry about whether or not I can accomplish everything on my list. Nor will I worry about the fact that I'm starting this on a random Tuesday. I felt like starting today, which is just as arbitrary as anything else. 

In the spirit of starting, here is my first act of tending: a photograph of my current stationery set up. I've been loyal to my Hobonichi Weeks and a Sailor Pro Gear fountain pen (medium fine) with Diamine Emerald ink to take notes during TTRPG sessions because the book is portable enough to fit in my Round Mini Shoulder Bag from Uniqlo that I've been carrying everywhere. The new Tomoe River Paper bleeds occasionally, which sucks, but it's still close enough to the original that it doesn't bother me enough to switch. I fill in the weekly spreads with what I did each day and use the weekly notes page on the right side to log a few to-do list items along with my daily memory. TTRPG session notes go in the back notes section. I'm keeping things incredibly minimal, just pen without any adorning of washi tape or stickers, and it just works for me.

If you're in a similar rut or have crawled out of one recently, I'd love to hear from you if only to feel less isolated in this lonely endeavor. Any insights or tips you feel inclined to share about getting out of ruts are appreciated!
