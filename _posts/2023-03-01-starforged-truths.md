Over millennia, we consumed resources and shattered lives as we fueled the engines of industry, expansion, and war. The governments of various planets adopted a breeding program as part of an arms race between a small number of large interplanetary factions in the center of the galaxy. People who did not wish to participate flew to the outskirts and became known as Strays.

In the end, a powerful foe took advantage of our rivalries in a violent bid for power. One government, using genetically modified soldiers, finally succeeded at their violent bid for power, toppling the other prominent factions. Building on this momentum, this singular force began to turn their attention to the Strays to fully unite them under the totalitarian regime. Fleeing the devastation, we, Strays, assembled our fleets and traveled to the Forge. A new home. A fresh start. 

Mysterious alien gates provided a one-way, instantaneous passage to the Forge. In the midst of the cataclysm, our ancestors found a strange metal pillar on our homeworld's moon. A map on the surface of this alien relic detailed the deep-space locations of the Iron Gates-massive devices that powered artificial wormholes. With no other options, the Exodus ships fled through the gates and emerged here in the Forge. 

With countless dangers, there's safety in numbers in the Forge. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans. We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and territorial skirmishes are common. 

Iron vows are sworn upon the remnants of ships that carried our people to the Forge. Many of our outposts were built from the iron bones of the Exodus ships. Fragments of the ships were also given to survivors as a remembrance, and passed from one generation to the next. Today, the Ironsworn swear vows upon the shards to honor the sacrifice of their forebears, the essence of the places left behind, and the souls of those great ships. 

Our communities are bound under the terms of the Covenant, a charter established after the Exodus. The organization called the Keepers is sworn to uphold those laws. Most settlements are still governed under the Covenant and yield to the authority of the Keepers. But a few view the Covenant as a dogmatic, impractical, and unjust relic of our past; in those places, the Keepers find no welcome. 

Our faith is as diverse as our people, yet many have no religion or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials-gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge. 

Supernatural powers are wielded by those rare people we call paragons. 
While not magic in the truest sense, the abilities of the paragons are as close to magic as we can conjure. These powers are born of Genetic engineering.

Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements. Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.

Orders of sworn healers preserve our medical knowledge and train new generations of caregivers. Life-saving advanced care is available within larger communities throughout the settled sectors of the Forge. Even remote communities are often served by a novice healer, or can request help from a healer's guild in an emergency. 

Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge. Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge.
