I honestly thought I might dodge covid forever and become some rare test subject in a future study to create a vaccine for covid-25 or something. I didn't though, so now I'm going through a year's worth of tissues in a week and knitting in bed for seven days until I meet the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/qa_03.html">Japanese guidance for leaving self-isolation</a>.

Although I'm taking [Xocova](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/02/22/national/science-health/shionogi-drug-long-covid-reduce/) (Japanese, lactose-free antiviral alternative to Paxlovid) and have started to feel much better, my brain feels so empty. It was so bad the day after first testing positive that I had to record a video on my phone while the pharmacist explained which medicines to take and when. It was like listening to an audiobook while falling asleep where all the words make sense, but if you ask yourself what you just heard you have no clue. I did have a 38.7Â°C/101.7Â°F fever at the time, so even standing up while sweating profusely was a struggle. My short-term memory has felt like a sieve since. I'm grateful I at least have a habit of writing everything down in my planner because otherwise I'd have to constantly count pills to make sure I've been taking them. For now, this side effect just feels odd because everything about finally catching a virus for the first time during a 3-year+ pandemic feels surreal. 
<br>
<br>
Anyways, my brain is working in weirder ways than usual, but it seems like my long-term memory is fine and accessible, so I figured it would be safe to pick up my occasional hobby of knitting to help pass the time. Realizing quickly that anything ambitious and complicated like a lace or color work was out of the question, I reached for a long-neglected and extremely simple cast-on: <a target="_blank" href="https://tinyowlknits.wordpress.com/the-beekeepers-quilt/">The Beekeeper's Quilt by Tiny Owl Knits</a>.

It's cottagecore circa 2012, and I've loved it from the moment I first saw it. In 2019, I actually made a significant dent in this project, resulting in more than 50 "hexipuffs", but my yarn has sat largely untouched since then. I'm happy to report that my grand total is now 66 puffs (not all pictured below), potentially large enough for what could be the world's lumpiest pillow.

Each puff takes about 30 minutes to knit, so that's about 30+ hours of knitting right there! Thankfully, they're simple enough that I was able to catch up on Critical Role and Dimension 20. Normally, I'd opt for an audiobook, but being so isolated has created this need to see other humans *humaning*, so I've preferred to watch actual play shows. If you have any good recommendations for TTRPG campaigns I should watch next let me know because I really am running out of knitflix content.

I'd be remiss if I didn't end this by thanking the many folks who sent well wishes on <a target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org/site/lostletters?event_id=2749392">my neocities profile</a>. I was honestly so shocked and heart-warmed by your kind gestures. I'm already feeling much better (hence this post) and no longer running a fever, so thank you all again. ðŸ¥¹
