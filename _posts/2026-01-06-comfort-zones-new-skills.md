On yesterday's long walk, I asked my friend, "What new skills did you acquire in 2025?" I was really impressed with how they dabbled in so many different things, and I realized that I hadn't tried as much because I was getting settled in a new city after two moves; however, last year, I still managed to...<!--excerpt-->
1. fight back against illegal abductions of my neighbors by educating myself, friends, neighbors, and local businesses about immigration authority protocols, how to document ICE activity, and our constitutional rights through canvassing and whistle packing events
2. volunteer with a local food bank, learning the picking process they use for packing clients' grocery orders
3. sew my first garment, which required installing my first zipper
4. learn how to do intarsia knitting, which was actually so easy
5. learn how to spin yarn on a drop spindle, which I then steamed and thwacked to create my first ever handspun yarn hank
6. play softball for the first time, learning new rules at every game

I'm glad I stretched myself to try new things last year, and I want to try to get outside of my comfort zone a bit more in 2026. Creatively, I am somewhat insecure about my singing and storytelling abilities. I am already scheduled to join a choir and take vocal lessons this year, but I don't really have anything to help me become a better story teller. If you know of any resources, particularly ones around crafting satisfying conclusions, please let me know. I also want to become fluent in Spanish, experience vipassana, study Buddhism, attend a gaming con, go camping, and attend a multi-day LARP.

While I think there's value in setting up new habits in the new year, it's also nice to plan things you're looking forward to as well. Have you thought about which skills you plan to pick up in 2026 or how you will get outside of your comfort zone this year?
