Congratulations to us for making it to yet another year! Before I get into what I'm doing in 2023, I wanted to note a few realizations I had about 2022 when I filled out my [YearCompass](https://yearcompass.com/):  
<!--excerpt-->
  
**1.** The wisest decision I made last year was attempting and completing the [couch-to-5k (C25K) running program](https://marathonhandbook.com/couch-to-5k-training-plan/). My memory of those runs are incredibly clear over a year later, and my mental health was mostly stable when I was running regularly.  \
**2.** The biggest lesson I learned was to spark personal interests and passions by revisiting childhood interests that I never fully explored. This site exists today because I got curious about web development again.  \
**3.** 2022 in 3 words: Home. Friendship. Efforts. Despite staying at home more this year than any other in my adult life (2022 was my most COVID-cautious year yet), I put a ton of effort into doing new things and maintaining connections to my closest friends. Compared to the extrovert who didn't know what to do at home after cleaning it for the third time that day in 2020, I'm now unrecognizable. I often spend hours in front of a computer in silence, surfing the small web and brimming with excitement for the stuff I'm learning online. I've had to adjust my self-concept a lot.

While I enjoy reflecting, I enjoy making resolutions and setting goals more. Here's what I'm hoping to achieve in 2023:
- **Site** - Projects to tackle this year
	- CSS theme switcher for dark mode - I'm really struggling with envisioning what a dark version of the site could look like, but I hope to get one up eventually
	- CSS showcase - All the ~~crimes against design~~ CSS I've learned condensed in one buck wild page.
	- TTRPG shrine - I started playing Ironsworn: Starforged with my partner, so I want to document and share that fast-paced sci-fi story here. 
- **Reading** - Last year was an incredibly unsatisfying reading year, because I tried and DNF-ed 15+ books. I only managed to finish 16 books total (7,743 pages), so I'm setting much more conservative goals this year:
	- **DONE** - Read daily in January for [The Story Graph January Pages Challenge](https://app.thestorygraph.com/january_pages_challenges/3ee9885d-775f-4eb5-84eb-82d8063044f4)
	- Finish 20 books this year. [I've already finished 9](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books-read/3744ead2-75cd-4a90-a9cb-7c85f68aab83?year=2023).
- **Health** - Physical exercise is critical to improving my ability to regulate my emotions, and I also want to see my body as strong and capable, so we're going to be moving *a lot* this year. I'm also unbelievably inspired by [Savannah Sachdev](https://www.instagram.com/savannahsachdev/) right now, who has run every day for 619+ days. 
	- Workout 3 days per week
	- Walk at least 10,000 steps daily
	- Run at least one 5km run monthly (I'll admit it, I want to do it because I'm addicted to earning Garmin and Strava badges)
	- If I have a close contact or get COVID, I won't work out at all until I'm fully in the clear to avoid long COVID. 
- **Stationery**
	- [Organize and plan my daily life](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmwfZRyJXt8/) in my [A5 Take A Note Planner](https://take-a-note.store/en/collections/2023-planner/products/2023-regular-planner-a5-eng) 
	- [Record a daily memory](https://www.instagram.com/p/CozliicpNQO/) in my [A5 English OURS Research Project Journal](https://booth.ours.tw/item/567)

Some goals I considered that didn't make the cut (at least not right now): 
- **Complete C25K again and maintain a regular running routine afterwards** - I mostly like running, and my brain benefits so much from it that I'd love to be the kind of person who runs daily. I struggle with motivation, and Tokyo summer heat makes a year-long running habit impossible. One of my friends is moving to my neighborhood this year and already agreed to running together, so I may run more than I expect this year regardless. 
- **[Blaugust](https://aggronaut.com/2022/07/15/introducing-blaugust-2022/)** - This is a daily blogging challenge during August. Since August is a particularly home-bound time of year for me due to inhospitable outdoor temperatures, I think I'm likely to publish at least some blog posts during that period. However, at this point in time, my blog isn't a core part of my site, and I don't even have comments enabledâ€”*webmentions are though!* Alternatively, I am intrigued by digital gardens and would like to start publishing my own eventually. I was tempted by [are.na](https://www.are.na/), [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/), and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), but I ultimately want something as clean as [Fork My Brain](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Fork+My+Brain).
- **Gaming** - My partner and I have played 32 hours of Star Wars: The Old Republic in 10 days. We're both having a ton of fun playing an MMO together for the first time. I don't want to put a goal around play time or anything because I want to enjoy it without pressure. 
- **Cook through an entire cookbook** - The vegan cookbooks from chefs I like rely on access to lots of ingredients that aren't easily available in Japanese supermarkets, making the challenge of figuring out suitable substitutions or obtaining expensive one-off ingredients something I'm just not interested in undertaking unless I move to N. America or Europe.
