While living in Japan has been an incredible privilege, it's also been extremely tough for as a vegan foreigner who doesn't know Japanese. I was extremely naive going into my first living abroad experience more than five years ago, so I wanted to write myself a letter with considerations from this time if I'm ever feeling the urge to live abroad again.<!--excerpt-->

**Life Admin & Taxes x2:** Do you really want to have to wrap your mind around not just the horrendously convoluted American tax system but also another country's tax system as well or spend hundreds of dollars getting professionals to hopefully do your taxes correctly for you? Do you want to have to work out whether it's better to take a foreign income exclusion or a foreign tax credit, and how working in another country affects your social security / pension totalization? Remember that you'll likely have to do all this adulting and more in a foreign language you don't know, escalating the complexity of every step.

**Language Barrier**: Becoming instantly illiterate in Japan significantly impacted your independence and autonomy. Consider how you'll feel being unable to communicate sufficiently in simple daily situations like ordering food with dietary restrictions to more complex and high-stakes situations like at the doctor's offices, labor union meetings, and more. Consider how your foreign language ability limits the number of healthcare providers your can possibly seek out without paying for a medical translator for every visit. Consider the social isolation you'll feel when you're limited in your ability to interact with strangers beyond body language and the most simple transactional conversations. Of course, English proficiency varies from country to country, so it may not be as severe as it was in Japan.

**Financial implications**: Remember when Japan's "safe haven currency" ended up tanking terribly, so you were making about as much as you did nearly ten years ago? Instead of making monopoly money, just earn US dollars, then take amazing vacations instead.

**Lifestyle accommodations**: Unless a city is considered a wonderland for vegans like Sydney, London, or Berlin, don't make your life infinitely harder and more socially isolating by always having to cook at home while you live there. 

**Distance from friends/family**: How quickly can you get back to see family in case of emergency? When the next pandemic hits and the world shuts its borders, will you still be able to maintain your most meaningful connections to an acceptable degree?

All of these considerations are ones that I've ultimately survived, but they have taken a irrefutable toll on my quality of life and financial security. No where is perfect--there will always be tradeoffs, but I hope that the next place where I decide to live will be the result of a much more thorough decision making process.
