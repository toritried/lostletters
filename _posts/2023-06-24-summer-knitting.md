I broke my "no contact" with a family member this week to follow up on something important and urgent, and I've been trying to staunch old emotional wounds and fresh frustration ever since. That paired with jet lag and hormonal changes this week was a lot to handle. As a result, I've been escaping into knitting for hours each day.<!--excerpt--> I started by making tons of "yarn cozies" that look like a sock to hold your yarn cake (pictured below). I ended up making 7 total, using up 73g of scrap yarn. I'm really excited to give one to my one friend who knits too as the cozies are the perfect accessory to help prevent your yarn from becoming a knotted mess.

After my cozy fixation, I decided it was time to treat myself for so responsibly burning down my yarn stash, so I looked into garments to knit. I settled on three:

I will be using stash yarn for this one, ripping out part of a sweater I didn't finish in order to reclaim the yarn for this project. I purchased this yarn in 2019 for $107.66 and expect to use nearly all of it for this project. Knitting garments for yourself is expensive no matter how you slice it because the cost isn't just material, it also takes up so much time too. If you enjoy knitting like I do, then you might think of the material costs as what you're paying to entertain or de-stress yourself divided by the number of hours you'll spend knitting, which might actually make it cheaper than other coping strategies, but it depends on the person.

Despite needing to relearn German Short Row shaping, I think the rest of this garment seems pretty straightforward. A lot of it is just straight stockinette knitting (the simplest type of knitting for the uninitiated), so this has become my mindless on-the-go project. I even went on an hour-long walk this morning and knit the whole time, since I don't have to look at it while I'm knitting. The photo above is from that walk.

As soon as I saw this pattern, I knew I wanted to knit it. I didn't have any yarn for this project in my stash, so I researched fiber for hours looking into yarn that would be suitable and obtainable in Japan. I settled on Sandnes Garn Line, which is a 53% Cotton, 33% Rayon, 14% Linen / Flax blend since this would be a summer top that requires a nice drape for the finished fabric. Now that I have it in my hands, I'm feeling somewhat better about the cost ($89.56 / ¥12,870 incl. shipping and taxes) to make this top in a suitable size. I already plan to knit another top with the same yarn, so no leftovers will be wasted while I also form a more cohesive capsule wardrobe. Figuring out which pieces of the same yarn could form a capsule wardrobe added a layer of complexity that I probably didn't need, but I found the distraction to be a helpful form of escapism.
<br>
<br>
The project also required math before I could get started in earnest. Since Sandnes Garn Line is a lighter weight than the one recommended in the pattern, I knit fewer stitches per inch than the pattern. Therefore, I had to do knitting math to figure out which size to knit in order to achieve my desired finished measurements, since the instructions are always for a specific number of stitches. I wish I had seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Tlk3kyNif3Q" target="_blank">this video about knitting math</a> prior to spending way too long learning to do it myself, but my solo approach means I'll actually remember how to do it in the future. In the case I don't, I took copious notes to be safe.

This is the last project that I got yarn for. It's another summer knit I hope to finish and wear this season. It's not my usual style, but I think it would look really nice with many things I already have. It also happens to be the cheapest yarn, coming in at $54.13 (€49.50), incl. shipping and taxes, so I finally get to enjoy a summer knit that's close to what I might spend on garment made of quality materials in stores. 
<br>
<br>
Building this part of my handmade wardrobe sent me down so many rabbit holes like researching fiber properties (e.g., cotton shrinks in the wash, but grows with wear) and which yarn brands I can procure in Japan. I also reflected a lot on the significant amount of dissatisfaction I've experienced with past finished objects. As a reckless, young knitter, I was always drawn to yarn that ended up being difficult to use. My deep stash of impulse purchases consists mostly of vibrant, clown vomit yarn and tons of single hanks of fingering / sock weight yarn. All these purchases were made without a project in mind, so I don't have sufficient quantities to knit garments of a suitable size. I regret all of it, and I'm not doing that anymore. I'm also tired of investing lots of money and time into making garments that don't suit me. 
<br>
<br>
All my frustrations finally forced me to figure out <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/L5wAFOTMaUM">which types of clothes suit my short torso and pear shape</a>. Surprise, it's mostly fit and flare dresses or combinations. Now, it is much easier for me to discern which knitting patterns I should knit for myself. Unfortunately, my desired silhouette isn't a popular one for knitting patterns, so there have to be some compromises. However, I can make informed choices about which fibers I'll knit garments out of in order to ensure they're suitable. 
<br>
<br>
Going forward, I want to create thoughtful and wearable pieces for my handmade wardrobe. I will be investing in raw material costs and dozens of hours of my own time for each piece I make. Therefore, I have to make sure I get a ton of wear out of these over a long period of time. For each piece I want to make now, I'll be following these steps:
1. **Pick a Suitable Pattern**: Look for covered shoulders, no deep V-necks, adjustable waist length for my short torso
2. **Research Yarn Options**: Figure out which fibers would give the proper drape and breathability for the finished fabric as well as the appropriate quantity by measuring myself to make an informed choice about garment ease / fit
3. **Knit a Gauge Swatch**: Knitting a swatch ensures your stitches and rows per inch will create a garment of the correct size. I also now live with a tape measurer at my desk, so I can take body measurements for patterns all the time.
