I'm currently in a very rare but exciting season of my life where I feel like I can and want to make commitments to myself again, so I've undertaken several: a new, fully remote job, The Artist's Way (a book that covers a 12-week program to revive your creativity), and walking 10,000 steps a day. Since I'm ever wary of my ability to sustain my commitments, this post will cover what I've been trying to do to make them viable long-term.<!--excerpt-->

To figure out how to make remote work work for me, I took to the internet, skipping over all those early 2020 videos that gave advice on how to adapt to a new pandemic reality. I looked for folks who had been working remotely for a decade or more, and primarily their advice boiled down to having a strict morning and evening routine to bookend the workday and taking breaks. I'm still figuring out the exact aspects of my morning routine, but so far I like to start out by making a fun-flavored coffee or tea to take on my 40-60+ minute morning walk before work. This walk helps me in a variety of ways:
- It psychologically replicates a commute to get me emotionally prepared for the work day ahead
- The long walk duration gets me close to my daily step goal of 10,000 steps since I'm not really doing any other form of exercise at the moment
- The sunlight helps wake me up fully (<a target="_blank" href-"https://youtu.be/h2aWYjSA1Jc?si=QwL2h3mgfOE2vr6c">more about the neuroscience here</a>)
- Seeing other people on their morning walks/runs and commutes takes me out of my head, reminding me that I'm not alone in my challenges nor in my persistence past them
- It gives me an opportunity to visualize my ideal self/life, practice affirmations, meditate, and read an audiobook, all of which come from the *Miracle Morning routine*
- It makes me feel like I'm taking care of myself first thing, which helps me trust myself to do so in the future

My evening routine looks very different. I try to have an evening event to look forward to after work, so I can fully detach. Before going to the event though, I like to make a list of what I need to work on the next day to give myself direction, log what I did that day for reporting purposes, put my laptop away, fully clean off my desk, and then get into my "Morning Pages" from The Artist's Way. If you're unfamiliar with morning pages, they're three hand-written stream-of-consciousness pages to be written first thing in the morning. I found no value in writing them before work as I'd have to immediately shut off my creative side and power through my emails and task lists. I felt it was a much better use of my time and energy to start the morning pages as soon as I had time to explore creative pursuits after work. Thus, I settled on writing my morning pages in the evening. I also don't write a full three pages. I fill two pages in my Hobonichi weeks notes section, using tiny cursive that fits within the miniscule grid paper. I felt like two pages was sufficient for me because I often get partially though these pages, and it still feels like a slog to complete. I also don't sweat it if I can't write my morning pages religiously every day. I'd rather stick with the program over 12-weeks than stop simply because I didn't write two full pages one day. 

Given that more adults than ever have had the experience of working or studying remotely thanks to the pandemic, I invite anyone to share their remote work routines and how they evolved over time. I'd love to learn from you! This post is meant to capture where I started out with my own routines, so that I can later reflect and iterate on it to make it even more helpful and sustainable for me in the future.
