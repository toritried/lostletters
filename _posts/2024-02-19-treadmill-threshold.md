This is a response to the third prompt from the <a target="_blank" href="https://museariadne.neocities.org/">muse ariadne</a> writing club: *write about a worldly place that is a threshold for you. this can mean anything-- maybe it's some place between end and beginning, forward and backward, past and present, here and there, friends and lovers, or something else entirely!*<!--excerpt-->

In college, I referred to the treadmill as the *dreadmill*. The monotony of staring at the same view while forcing myself to strain my physical limits was simply too much to bear. A decade later, things have changed. Early on in the pandemic, I found myself taking solace in the mundane and monotonous--touchstones that signified that not everything was different; a shred of normalcy I could physically touch, hold, cherish. I remember the very moment I took solace in it for the first time: I was standing in my tiny Tokyo kitchenette, meticulously mincing an onion on a cutting board I squeezed onto the countertop between my induction burner and sink, thinking for the first time in my life that this was actually nice, zen even. I had no where to be, no plans. I could take all the time in the world to reduce that onion into smaller discrete pieces. That onion heralded a new chapter of my life, one in which the treadmill could become such a revered threshold for me.

It's more than just a machine that sets my body into a slow and steady rhythm. From the moment I step on the treadmill, I banish every negative self-thought within me out of sheer necessity. With each run, the treadmill has held up a mirror to my soul a hundred times and asked, "Are you going to quit on this run? Are you going to quit on yourself?" and through gritted teeth, I've said, "I didn't come this far to only come this far," a hundred times back. Towards the last kilometer of every run, I think to myself, "Savor this. It's almost over." Between my variable mental health and the state of the world, I never know if it's going to be my last run, my last chance to step on the treadmill to prove myself, but, in those fleeting seconds, I always find a way to push myself like it will be.
